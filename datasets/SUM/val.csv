"When we have identified through our age-screening process that a child under 13 is trying to register an account with us, we immediately ""hash"" that user's e-mail into a nonreversible character string and discard the e-mail.

"When a child under the age of 13 registers for an account, we use hashing to create a password reminder system that does not require us to retain that child's email address.

If Valve is unable to resolve your concerns and a dispute remains between you and Valve, this Section explains how the parties have agreed to resolve it.</p>
<p>YOU AND VALVE AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US IN INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION.
THAT INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO: (i) ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US.
(ii) THIS AGREEMENT.
OR (iii) YOUR USE OF STEAM, YOUR ACCOUNT OR THE CONTENT AND SERVICES.
IT APPLIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS ARE BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, UNFAIR COMPETITION, MISREPRESENTATION OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY.</p>
<p>However, this Section does not apply to the following types of claims or disputes, which you or Valve may bring in any court with jurisdiction: (i) claims of infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, including such claims seeking injunctive relief.
and (ii) claims related to or arising from any alleged unauthorized use, piracy or theft.</p>
<p>This Section does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from us for you.</p>
<p>An arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of before a judge or jury.

YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND VALVE ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND TO HAVE A TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.</p>
<p>You and Valve agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to informally resolve any dispute before initiating arbitration.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other a written notice that describes the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and sets forth the relief sought.
If you and Valve do not reach an agreement to resolve that claim or dispute within 30 days after the notice is received, you or Valve may commence an arbitration.

""Your IP address(es) and user-agent(s) are private and are not visible to anybody except to Lichess moderators. This information is used to moderate the website and prevent abuse.

The specific fingerprint information is not visible to any user, including the moderators. Moderators can only see the word “print” in their “mod-zone” (should the user have multiple accounts): it aids moderators to determine if a certain user is creating multiple accounts.

“Blurs” are how many times your game’s window lose focus: i.e.: leaving the game's window once counts as one blur. “Blurs” are only visible to moderators and is one of many factors used in cheat evaluation.","The service may use tracking pixels, web beacons, browser fingerprinting, and/or device fingerprinting on users."

II General information about data processing
1.Extent of the processing of personal data

We collect and use personal information from our users only to the extent necessary to provide a functional website, content and services. The collection and use of personal data from our users takes place only with the consent of the user. An exception applies to cases in which prior consent can not be obtained for factual reasons, and processing the data is permitted by law.
2.Legal basis for the processing of personal data

When we obtain the consent of the data subject for processing personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis.

When processing personal data necessary for completing a contract, in which the data subject is a party, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b of the GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations required to carry out pre-contractual actions.

When the processing of personal data is required to fulfil a legal obligation to which our foundation is subjected, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c of the GDPR serves as the legal basis.

In the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. d of the GDPR serves as the legal basis.

If processing is necessary to safeguard the factual interests of our foundation or a third party, and if the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh those interests, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing.
3.Deletion of data and storage duration

The personal data of the data subject will be deleted or blocked as soon as the reason for storage expires. In addition, data storage may occur when required by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other regulations to which the controller is subject. Restriction or deletion of data also occurs when a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless there is a need for longer storage of the data, for entering or fulfilment of a contract.
III Accessing the website and creation of log files
1.Description and extent of data processing

Each time our website is accessed, our system automatically collects data and information from the requesting computer. The following data is collected:

    Information about the user's web browser and its version;

    The user's operating system;

    The user's IP address;

    The date and time of access;

    Websites from which the user's system reaches our website;

    Websites that are accessed by the user's system through our website.

The data is also stored in our systems' log files. Storage of this data together with other personal data of the user does not occur.
2.Legal basis for data processing

The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR.
3.Reason for data processing

Temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to deliver the website to the user's computer. To do this, the user's IP address must be stored for the duration of the session.

Storage in log files occurs to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, the data is used to optimise the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. Analysis of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.

For these purposes, our factual interest in the processing of data is according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR.
4.Duration of storage

The data will be deleted as soon as it is not needed to achieve the purposes for which it was collected. In the case of data collection used to providing the website, this takes place when the respective session is completed.

For data storage in log files, this takes place after fourteen days at the latest. Longer storage is possible. In this case, the IP addresses of the users are deleted or obfuscated, so that linking the data to the requesting client is no longer possible.
5.Option to object and remove data

The collection of data for accessing the website and the storage of the data in log files is essential for the operation of the website. There is consequently no option for users to opt-out of this data collection.
IV Usage of cookies
1.Description and extent of data processing

Our website uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in or by the web browser on the user's computer systems. When a user visits a website, a cookie may be stored in the user's operating system. This cookie contains a characteristic string that allows the browser to be uniquely identified when the website is revisited.

We use cookies to make our website more user-friendly. Some elements of our website require that the requesting browser can be identified even across multiple sessions. Only a random ID is stored in the cookie and transmitted.

In addition, some services offered through our web servers use cookies to store custom settings across sessions. These are in particular: Jitsi (the specified user name is stored), OpenGrok (search preferences), WordPress (user name, URL and email address) and EtherPad (user name and text colour assigned to it). It is not necessary to provide a username in order to use these services.

When accessing our website, users are informed by a banner about the use of cookies for analysis purposes, and users are referred to this privacy policy. In this context, there is also information of how browser settings can be changed to prevent the storage of cookies.
2.Legal basis for data processing

The legal basis for the processing of personal data using cookies is Art. 6 (1) lit. f of the GDPR.
3.Reason for data processing

The reason for using cookies is to simplify the use of the websites. Some features of our website cannot be provided without the use of cookies. For these, it is necessary that the browser can be recognized across multiple sessions.

We require cookies for the following:

    To keep logins active.

    To preserve individual settings such as user names or search preferences.

The user data collected via those technically necessary cookies will not be used to create user profiles.

For these purposes, our factual interest in the processing of personal data is pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR.
4.Duration of storage, and option to object and remove data

Cookies are stored on the users's computer and transmitted by the computer to our website. Therefore, as a user, you have full control over the use of cookies.

VIII Web analytics via Matomo
1.Extent of processing of personal data

On our website, we use the open-source software tool Matomo (formerly Piwik) to analyse the browsing behaviour of our users. This software creates a cookie on the computer of the users (for details about cookies, see above). When individual pages of our website are accessed, the following data is stored:

    Two bytes of the IP address of the user's system

    The website that is accessed

    The website which led the user to access our website (referrer)

    The subpages that accessed from the website that was accessed

    The session duration on the website (how long the user accesses it)

    How often the website is accessed

The software runs exclusively on our website's servers. Storage of personal data only takes place there. Transfer of the data to third parties does not take place.

The software is configured such that the IP addresses are not stored completely, but two bytes of the IP address are masked (eg 192.168.xxx.xxx). In this way, it is no longer possible to associate the shortened IP address with the requesting computer.
2.Legal basis for the processing of personal data

The legal basis for processing users' personal data is Article 6 (1) lit. f of the GDPR.
3.Reason for data processing

The processing of users' personal data enables us to analyse the browsing behaviour of our users. By analysing the obtained data, we are able to compile information about the use of individual parts of our website. This helps us to constantly improve our website and its user-friendliness. For these purposes, our factual interest lies in the processing of the data according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR. The anonymisation of the IP address takes into account the interests of users regarding protection of their personal data.
4.Duration of storage

The data will be deleted as soon as is is no longer required for our recording purposes. In our case, this takes place after 180 days.
5.Option to object and remove data

On the site https://www.documentfoundation.org/privacy, we offer our users the option to opt out of the analysis process. For this, you must follow the appropriate link. In this way, another cookie is set on your system, which tells our systems to not save the user's data. If the user deletes the corresponding cookie in the meantime from his own system, he must set the opt-out cookie again.
IX Payment service providers
1.Extent of processing of personal data

On our website, we offer the opportunity to make a donation to us. We use external payment service providers whose platforms allow users to make payment transactions to us - e.g. (in parenthesis the link to the privacy policy): Paypal (https://www.paypal.com/de/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full?locale.x=en_GB#Updated_PS), Stripe (https://stripe.com/privacy), CoinGate (https://coingate.com/privacy), BitPay (https://bitpay.com/about/privacy), Flattr (https://flattr.com/privacy), Visa (https://usa.visa.com/legal/privacy-policy.html), Mastercard (https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/about-mastercard/what-we-do/privacy.html).

    the chosen amount and currency;

    the website from which the donator initiated the donation;

    whether the donation is a one-off, or recurring;

    (optionally) the email address of the donator.

X Integration of third party services
1.Type and extent

Our websites use third party services. They are integrated dynamically into web pages. These services can set cookies from the respective providers on your computer, and also execute JavaScript code.
1.1.Use of Google Maps

On our websites, we use the ""Google Maps"" component from Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, hereafter referred to as ""Google"".

Each time Google Maps is accessed, Google sets a cookie to process user settings and data when viewing the page that has the Google Maps component integrated. This cookie is usually not deleted by closing the browser, but it will expire after a certain amount of time unless it is manually deleted by you.

If you disagree with the processing of your data, you may disable the ""Google Maps"" service and prevent the transmission of data to Google in this way. To do this, you must disable the JavaScript feature in your browser. However, please note that in this case you will not be able to use ""Google Maps"" at all, or only to a limited extent.

Use of ""Google Maps"" and information obtained through ""Google Maps"" is subject to the Google Terms of Use:

http://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/terms/regional.html

and the additional terms and conditions for ""Google Maps"":

https://www.google.com/intl/de_de/help/terms_maps.html.
1.2.Use of reCAPTCHA

To protect data entry forms on our websites, we use the service ""reCAPTCHA"" from Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, hereafter referred to as ""Google"". Through the use of this service, it can be determined whether the corresponding input is from a human, or the form is being abused by automated machine processing.

To our knowledge, the following are transferred to ""Google"": referrer URL, the IP address, the behaviour of the website visitors, information about the operating system, browser and duration, cookies, presentation instructions and scripts, the input behaviour of the user and mouse movements in the ""reCAPTCHA"" checkbox.

Among other things, Google uses this information to digitize books and other printed materials, as well as to optimize services such as Google Street View and Google Maps (eg house number and street name recognition).

The IP address submitted as part of ""reCAPTCHA"" will not be merged with any other data provided by Google, unless you are logged in to your Google Account at the time you use the ""reCAPTCHA"" plug-in. If you want to prevent this transmission and storage of data about you and your behaviour on our website by ""Google"", you must log out of ""Google"" before you visit our site or use the reCAPTCHA plug-in.

Use of the information obtained by the ""reCAPTCHA"" service is in accordance with the Google Terms of Use:

https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/.
1.3.Use of Twitter Recommendation Component

We use components from the Twitter service on our websites. Twitter is a service of Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, United States.

Each time you visit our websites which contain such a component, this component causes the browser you are using to download a corresponding representation of the component of Twitter. Through this process, Twitter is informed about which specific page of our website is currently being visited.

We have no control over the information that Twitter collects here, nor about the amount of data collected by Twitter. To the best of our knowledge, Twitter collects the URL of the respective website and the user's IP address, but it is not used for purposes other than the presentation of the Twitter component. Further information can be found in the privacy policy of Twitter at http://twitter.com/privacy.

You can change your privacy settings in the Account Settings at http://twitter.com/account/settings.
1.4.Use of YouTube components with advanced privacy mode

On our websites, we use components (videos) from the company YouTube, LLC 901 Cherry Ave., 94066 San Bruno, CA, a company of Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.

Here we use the option provided by YouTube ""- extended privacy mode -"".

When you visit a page that has an embedded video, it will connect to the YouTube servers and display the content by notifying your browser on the website.

According to information provided by YouTube, in ""- enhanced privacy mode -"" data is only transmitted to the YouTube server when watching the video, in particular which of our web pages you have visited. If you are logged in to YouTube at the same time, this information will be associated with your membership account on YouTube. You can prevent this by logging out of your account before visiting our website.

Additional information about YouTube's privacy is provided by Google at the following link:

https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/
1.5.Use of Vimeo components

We use components of the Vimeo service on our website. Vimeo is a service of Vimeo LCC, 555 West 18th Street, NY, New York 10011, USA. Each time you visit a web page which has such a component, this component causes the browser you are using to download a corresponding representation of the component from Vimeo. When you visit our site and you are logged in to Vimeo, Vimeo recognises, through the information gathered by the component, which specific site you are visiting and assigns this information to your personal Vimeo account. If, for instance, you click the ""Play"" button or leave a comment, this information will be transmitted to your personal Vimeo account and stored there. In addition, the fact that you have visited our site is passed on to Vimeo. This happens regardless of whether you, for instance, click on the component, or leave comments, or not.

If you wish to stop this transmission and storage of data about you and your behaviour on our website through Vimeo, you must log out of Vimeo before you visit our site. The privacy notices of Vimeo provide more detailed information, in particular for the collection and use of data by Vimeo: https://vimeo.com/privacy
1.6.Use of social media buttons with ""Shariff""

We use the c't project ""Shariff"" on our website. ""Shariff"" replaces the usual social media sharing buttons, thereby protecting browsing behaviour.

""Shariff"" integrates social network share buttons on our website only as graphics, which contain a link to the corresponding social network. By clicking on the corresponding graphic you will be redirected to the services of the respective network. The Shariff button does not establish direct contact between the social network and our visitors, until the visitor actively clicks on the share button. Only then will your data be transmitted to the respective social network. If the Shariff button is not clicked, there will be no exchange between you and the social networks. More information about the c't project ""Shariff"" can be found at http://www.heise.de/ct/artikel/Shariff-Social-Media-Buttons-mit-Datenschutz-2467514.html

We integrate the following social networks on our website with ""Shariff"":

    Facebook

    Twitter

    Google+

    flattr

    LinkedIn

    bitpay

2.Legal basis for data processing

The legal basis for the processing of personal data using cookies is in Article 6 (1) lit. f of the GDPR.
3.Reason for data processing

The reason for the usage is to make the websites easier to use. Some features of our website can not be offered without the use of third-party components.
4.Duration of storage, and option to object and remove data

Cookies are stored on the users's computer and transmitted by the computer to our website. Therefore, as a user, you have full control over the use of cookies. By changing the settings in your web browser, you can disable or restrict the transmission of cookies. Cookies that have been saved already can be deleted at any time. This can also be done automatically. If cookies are disabled for our website, it may not be possible to use all the features of our website in full.

If additional JavaScript code is executed, you can also prevent this. To do this, you must disable the JavaScript feature in your web browser. However, please note that in this case you will not be able to use the associated services, or only to a limited extent.

California Consumer Privacy Rights<p>You have certain choices regarding your personal information, as described below.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Access:</strong> You have the right to request, twice in a 12-month period, that we disclose to you the personal information we have collected, used, disclosed and sold about you during the past 12 months.</li>
<li>
<strong>Deletion:</strong> You have the right to request that we delete certain personal information we have collected from you.</li>
<li>
<strong>Opt-Out of Sale:</strong> You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>How to Submit a Request.</strong> To submit an access or deletion request, please log into your Foursquare account or call us at (855)-505-8916.</p>
<p>To opt-out of the sale of your personal information, click here or email us at privacy@foursquare.com.</p>
<p>You must provide us with your device identifier, which we will use to fulfill your opt-out request.
If you do not know your device identifier, below are instructions on how to locate it.
We will not use the information you provide as part of your request for any purpose other than to fulfill your opt-out request.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you use an iOS operating system, a third-party application is required to locate your Apple IDFA.
Please note that we do not control such third-party tools and are not responsible for their content, their privacy policies, or their use of your personal information.</li>
<li>If you use an Android operating system, open the Google Settings app on your Android device and select “Ads.” Your Advertising Identifier should be listed at the bottom of the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>To submit a request as an authorized agent on behalf of a consumer, please send us a notarized power of attorney and/or other legal documentation.
Requests from agents that do not submit sufficient proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf will be denied.
For questions or concerns about our privacy policies and practices, please contact us as described in the “Contact Us” section of our Enterprise Services Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>Verifying Requests.</strong> To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take&nbsp;steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with your request.
If you have an account with us, we are unable to fulfill your access or deletion requests at this time because there is no reasonable method by which we can verify your identity to the level of certainty required by California law.
The reason for this is that Foursquare historically has not linked IP addresses, device identifiers or other information collected through automated means to named actual persons unless the individual uses the Consumer Services.</p>
<p>
<strong>Additional Information.</strong> If you choose to exercise any of your rights under the CCPA, you have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment by us.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.</p>

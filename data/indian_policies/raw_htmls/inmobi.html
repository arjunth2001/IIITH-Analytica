We partner with third-party mobile website publishers and mobile app developers to serve ads on their sites and in their apps, and InMobi may also serve ads on the site and mobile applications that InMobi owns. These ads may be customised to their users\u0026amp;#39; interests and geographic locations, which we may derive or infer from information that we collect about how those users interact with such sites and apps (this type of advertising is often called \u0026quot;interest-based advertising\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;targeted advertising\u0026quot;). This enables our partnering publishers and developers to provide content-rich services that are more relevant to their users, often using the advertising revenues they generate to offer their services for free or at a subsidised cost. Further, we may also obtain user data from our data partners, advertisers and\\/or advertisers\u0026amp;rsquo; partners for optimising digital advertising and\\/or analytical purposes including to provide relevant advertising and reporting. Please note that collection, use or storage of such data is governed by the privacy policy of such third-party partners and\\/or advertisers providing the same. InMobi also engages in campaign planning, measurement (e.g. whether an advertisement was viewed, its timestamp etc.) and attribution of advertisements, whether by itself or through third party measurement partners. InMobi may engage in cross-device data collection, which refers to the process of collecting data from devices that have been determined through statistical analysis to be linked or related.

The General Data Protection Regulation (the \u0026amp;ldquo;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;GDPR\u0026lt;\\/strong\u0026gt;\u0026amp;rdquo;), is a new piece of legislation which will largely supersede the DPA on 25 May 2018. The GDPR will then apply to the processing a party carries out on the other party\u0026amp;rsquo;s behalf under the Agreement. The GDPR requires data processing contracts \u0026amp;ndash; such as the Agreement \u0026amp;ndash; to contain additional provisions regulating the processing of personal data. As a result we wish to add the Data Protection Rider, set out in the schedule attached, to the Agreement with effect from the date stated on the top of this Rider (the \u0026amp;ldquo;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Variation Date\u0026lt;\\/strong\u0026gt;\u0026amp;rdquo;). Additionally, due to the implementation of the GDPR, we are required to adhere to new rules relating to the international transfer of personal data. One of the simplest ways to protect the personal data transferred between you and us is to use the \u0026amp;ldquo;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Model Contract Clauses\u0026lt;\\/strong\u0026gt;\u0026amp;rdquo;, produced by the European Commission, which are incorporated into this Rider as if they had been set out in full.

Media Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Demand Partner at least 10 business days prior notification of any material changes to the Site (excluding Affiliate Promotion Properties) that would materially change the target audience or materially affect the size or placement of the Ad specified on the applicable IO. Should such a modification occur with or without notice, as Demand Partner\u0026amp;#39;s \u0026amp;#39;s sole remedy for such change, Demand Partner may cancel the remainder of the affected placement without penalty within the 10-day notice period.

Media Company acknowledges that certain Demand Partners may not want their Ads placed adjacent to content that promotes pornography, violence, or the use of firearms, contains obscene language, or falls within another category stated on the IO (\u0026quot;Editorial Adjacency Guidelines\u0026quot;). Media Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with the Editorial Adjacency Guidelines with respect to Ads that appear on Media Company Properties, although Media Company will at all times retain editorial control over the Media Company Properties. For Ads shown on Network Properties and Affiliate Promotion Properties, Media Company and Demand Partner agree that Media Company\u0026amp;#39;s sole responsibilities with respect to compliance with these Editorial Adjacency Guidelines will be to obtain contractual representations from its participating network publishers that such publishers will comply with Editorial Adjacency Guidelines on all Network Properties and to provide the remedy specified below to Demand Partner with respect to violations of Editorial Adjacency Guidelines on Network Properties. Should Ads appear in violation of the Editorial Adjacency Guidelines, Demand Partner\u0026amp;#39;s sole and exclusive remedy is to request in writing that Media Company remove the Ads and provide makegoods or, if no makegood can be agreed upon, issue a credit to Demand Partner equal to the value of such Ads, or not bill Demand Partner for such Ads. In cases where a makegood and a credit can be shown to be commercially infeasible for the Demand Partner and Media Company will negotiate an alternate solution. After Demand Partner notifies Media Company that specific Ads are in violation of the Editorial Adjacency Guidelines, Media Company will make commercially reasonable efforts to correct such violation within 24 hours. If such correction materially and adversely impacts such IO, Demand Partner and Media Company will negotiate in good faith mutually agreed changes to such IO to address such impacts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Demand Partner acknowledges and agrees that, subject to applicable laws, no Demand Partner will be entitled to any remedy for any violation of the Editorial Adjacency Guidelines resulting from: (i) Ads placed at locations other than the Sites by Demand Partner, or (ii) Ads displayed on properties including Affiliate Promotion Properties that Demand Partner is aware, or should be aware, may contain content in potential violation of the Editorial Adjacency Guidelines including Affiliate Promotion Properties. For any page on the Site that primarily consists of user-generated content, the preceding paragraph will not apply. Instead, Media Company will make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Ads are not placed adjacent to content that violates the Site\u0026amp;#39;s terms of use. Demand Partner\u0026amp;#39;s sole remedy for Media Company\u0026amp;#39;s breach of such obligation will be to submit written complaints to Media Company, which will review such complaints and remove user-generated content that Media Company, in its sole discretion, determines is objectionable or in violation of such Site\u0026amp;#39;s terms of use.\u0026lt;br \\/\u0026gt;\\n\u0026lt;br \\/\u0026gt;\\n\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;PAYMENT AND PAYMENT LIABILITY\u0026lt;\\/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;\\/p\u0026gt;\\n\\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026amp;middot;Invoices.

All invoices (other than corrections of previously provided invoices) pursuant to the IO will be sent within 90 days of delivery of all Deliverables. Media Company acknowledges that failure by Media Company to send an initial invoice within such period may cause Demand Partner (if such Demand Partner is an Agency) to be contractually unable to collect payment from the Advertiser. If Media Company sends the initial invoice after the 90-day period and the Demand Partner either has not received the applicable funds from the Advertiser or does not have the Advertiser\u0026amp;#39;s consent to dispense such funds, Demand Partner will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Media Company in collecting payment from the Advertiser or obtaining Advertiser\u0026amp;#39;s consent to dispense funds. Any failure by Demand Partner to invoice the Advertiser within this time frame shall not in any way limit Media Company\u0026amp;#39;s ability to collect funds from the Advertiser.\u0026lt;\\/p\u0026gt;\\n\\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026amp;middot;Upon request from the Demand Partner, Media Company should provide proof of performance for the invoiced period, which may include access to online or electronic reporting, as addressed in these Terms, subject to the notice and cure provisions of Section IV.

Provided credit is approved, payment is due thirty (30) days from the invoice date unless otherwise agreed in writing by Media Company. Media Company may notify Demand Partner that it has not received payment in such 30-day period and whether it intends to seek payment directly from Demand Partner pursuant to Section III(c), below, and Media Company may do so five (5) business days after providing such notice. In the event of non-payment, and without limiting any other remedies, Media Company may offset any amounts due to Media Company against any amounts due from Media Company to Demand Partner under any agreement or IO or may offset such amounts against any charges for media to be delivered by Media Company.\u0026lt;\\/p\u0026gt;\\n\\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026amp;middot;Payment Liability. Media Company may hold Demand Partner liable for payments due by Advertiser, as the disclosed agent of the Advertiser, in the event of non-payment by Advertiser for Ads placed in accordance with the terms of the IO. Demand Partner agrees that Media Company may hold Demand Partner liable for payments in the event that proceeds have not cleared from Advertiser for Ads placed in accordance with the IO. Advertiser shall keep records related to payments made by it to Demand Partner with respect to services provided by Media Company under this Agreement and Demand Partner shall keep records related to payments received by it from Advertiser with respect to services provided by Media Company under this Agreement, and upon reasonable notice from Media Company, Advertiser and Demand Partner shall allow Media Company to review such records. Unless otherwise set forth by the Media Company in the IO, a 2% per month (pro-rated for part thereof) penal interest on late payments shall be levied from the date of receipt of an invoice by the Media Company.\u0026lt;\\/p\u0026gt;\\n\\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026amp;middot;Demand Partner agrees to make every reasonable effort to collect and clear payment from Advertiser on a timely basis.\u0026lt;\\/p\u0026gt;\\n\\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026amp;middot;Demand Partner\u0026amp;#39;s credit is established on a client-by-client basis.\u0026lt;\\/p\u0026gt;\\n\\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026amp;middot;If Advertiser proceeds have not cleared for the IO, other advertisers from Demand Partner will not be prohibited from advertising on the Site due to such non-clearance if such other advertisers\u0026amp;#39; credit is not in question.\u0026lt;\\/p\u0026gt;\\n\\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026amp;middot;Upon request, Demand Partner will make available to Media Company written confirmation of the relationship between Demand Partner and Advertiser.

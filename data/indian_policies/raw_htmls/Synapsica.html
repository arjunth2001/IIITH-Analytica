            customers and our operations are spread around the world. As a
            result, we collect and transfer Personal Data on a global basis.

            expressly prohibit us from doing so), that we may transfer your
            Personal Data to locations outside of your country.
          </li>

            asked for some Personal Data. This type of safeguard is designed to
            ensure that only you, or someone authorised by you, has access to

        If you continue to receive our communications after expressing an opt-out preference, please let us know so that we can investigate the situation.
        We will, however, continue to send transaction-based emails if you engage in a transaction, request customer support, or make similar requests.

        <p>
        TA takes steps to help us protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.
        However, information submitted via the Internet, including through a web page, email, or mobile communications,
        is subject to interception or incorrect routing, and the Internet is not a fully secure communications channel.
        Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant that your information will never be accessed, used, or disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h2 id="cali">California Privacy Rights</h2>
        <h4>1. Privacy Rights</h4>
        <p>
        Under the CCPA, California residents may have certain privacy rights, including the rights to:  (i) request additional information and obtain a copy of Personal Information, i.e., a "Request to Know, " sometimes called the "Right to Access;" (ii) request deletion of Personal Information, i.e., a "Request to Delete Information," sometimes called the "Right to Be Forgotten; " and (iii) opt out of the sale of Personal Information if TA were to sell Personal Information, i.e., a "Request to Opt Out." TA does not sell your information as defined in the CCPA, so you are already opted-out of such sales. TA will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights, for example, by charging a different price or denying goods or services. However, TA may charge a different price or rate or provide a different level or quality of goods or services when that difference is reasonably related to the value provided to us by the data.
        </p>
        <h4>2. How to Exercise Data Subject Rights</h4>
        <p>
        If you wish to exercise your California privacy rights please call us toll-free at 1-800-632-9240 or complete this web form <a href="https://www.access-billing-services.com/Loyalty/ConsumerInfoReq.aspx">https://www.access-billing-services.com/Loyalty/ConsumerInfoReq.aspx</a>. We will review your requests and respond accordingly. The rights described herein are not absolute and we reserve all of our rights available to us at law in this regard. Additionally, if we retain your Personal Information only in de-identified form, we will not attempt to re-identify your data in response to a California Privacy Rights request.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you make a request related to Personal Information about you, we will need to verify your identity. To do so, we will request that you match specific pieces of information you have provided us previously, as well as, in some instances, provide a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request. If it is necessary to collect additional information from you, TA will use the information only for verification purposes and will delete it as soon as practicable after complying the request. For requests related to particularly sensitive information, we may require additional proof of identification.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you make a California Privacy Rights request through an authorized agent, we will require written proof that the agent is authorized to act on your behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
        We will process your request within the time provided by applicable law.
        </p>
        <h4>3. California "Shine the Light"</h4>
        <p>
        In addition to the rights already described, under California Law, California residents have the right to request certain details about how their information is shared with third parties and, in some cases, affiliates, for those third parties' and affiliates' own direct marketing purposes. Under the law, a business must either provide this information or permit California customers to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing.
        </p>
        <p>
        We may from time to time elect to share certain information about you collected by us in the course of providing the Services with third parties or affiliates for those third parties' or affiliates' own direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident, you may request the above information or opt out of such future sharing of your personal information (as defined by the California Shine the Light Act) by contacting us using the information in the <strong>Contact Us</strong> section below. We will respond to these requests within thirty (30) days. Requests that come by other means may result in a delayed response.

The information we collect from you may include your name, age, mailing address, daytime telephone number, cell phone number, e-mail address, account user name and password, and payment information. If you use a third party login to register or otherwise link to us, we may receive certain information about you from the third party (such as a social network) based on your registration and privacy settings on that third party service.<br>
<i>Registration.</i>&nbsp;We encourage you to register when shopping on our Site or App; however registration is not required. Our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.footlocker.com/account/create">Registration Form</a>&nbsp;requires users to provide contact information (such as name, age, mailing address, daytime telephone number, cell phone number, e-mail address and password).&nbsp;<b>You must be 13 years of age or older to register.</b>&nbsp;Registration helps us to provide you with a quick and simple checkout experience.

<i>Information We Automatically Collect.</i>&nbsp;We may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, log files, or other technologies to automatically collect certain information when you use our Site or App, or interact with our emails or advertisements on our Site, our App, or other websites. A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. For example, we may automatically collect information such as your IP address, geolocation data, unique user ID, cell phone model, operating system, and carrier, and Internet Service Provider. We also may collect information about your use of our Services, such as the time you spend using the Site or App, the number of times you return, whether you click-through, open, or forward links, emails, and ads, and other Service usage data.

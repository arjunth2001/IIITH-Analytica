							<h3>Personal Information Collected Through the Services</h3>
							<p>We collect two types of information:  Personal Information and Other Information.</p>
							<p>"Personal Information" is information: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>that identifies or can be used to identify your household;
								</li><li>that relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked (directly or indirectly) with you or your household; 
								</li><li>that can be used to authenticate you or provide access to an account; 
								</li><li>that relates to you and that might be sensitive (such as personal medical or health information, account number, account value).
							</li></ul>	
							<p>Personal Information includes "Sensitive Personal Information" (as that is defined by the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation).</p>
							<p>"Other Information" is information that does not and cannot reveal an individual's specific identity, such as information that has been de-identified or aggregated.  </p>
							<p>Citi collects and uses certain Personal Information in order to operate and provide you with access to the Services. This includes Personal Information that you provide to us and Personal Information that we collect automatically when you visit or interact with the Services.</p>
							
							<p><b>Information That You Provide to Us</b></p>
							<p>We collect personal Information that you voluntarily provide to us when you use the Services. This information includes, without limitation: your email addresses, telephone numbers, and other contact details; the identity of your current employer and other biographical information; feedback on our websites or mobile apps; online preferences, such as Citi News alerts selections; and business information, such as your company name, your role, and industry.</p>
							
							<p><b>Information That We Collect About Your Use of the Services</b></p>
							<p>We collect information about your use of the Services and about the device you use to access the Services, including: the pages you request and visit; the posts you submit; information on your interaction with other users; information obtained in the course of maintaining or supporting the Services; information about your internet use, such as your IP address, the URLs of sites from which you arrive or leave the Services, your type of browser, your operating system, your internet service provider; and, if you access the Services via your mobile device, we may also collect information about your mobile provider and type of mobile device.</p>
							<p>We (and our service providers) use different technologies to collect this information, including cookies and web beacons. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular, and count visits. Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, and understand usage and campaign effectiveness. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, please see "Your Choices" below.</p>
									
							<h3>Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others</h3>
							<p>We may allow others to provide analytics services and serve advertisements on our behalf across the web and in mobile applications. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, device identifiers and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites and applications, including your IP address, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in apps, links clicked, and conversion information. For more information about interest-based ads, or to opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" title="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_new">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.  Your device may also include a feature ("Limit Ad Tracking" on iOS or "Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads" or "Opt Out of Ads Personalization" on Android) that allows you to opt out of having certain information collected through apps used for behavioral advertising purposes.  Depending upon your device features and your ad choices, this information may be used by us and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites, and better understand your online activity.</p>

								</li><li>In connection with a sale or business transaction, such as to an acquiring entity or its advisors in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).
							</li></ul>
							<p>We may also share aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you to help deliver products, services, and content that are tailored to the users of our online Services and for other purposes.  </p>
							<p>We may transfer information to Citi affiliated companies or other parties throughout the world, for example to process transactions and provide you with products and services.

							<h3>Supplemental provision applicable to California residents</h3>
							<p><b>Requests</b></p>
							<p>California residents have certain rights with respect to Personal Information under the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA").  For purposes of this subsection, the terms "consumer," "categories of personal information," "business purpose," "third party," and "sell" have the meanings ascribed to them respectively in the CCPA.  Terms defined under the CCPA may differ in meaning from the common usage of the same terms used elsewhere in this Notice.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>You have the right to request, up to two times every 12 months, that Citi disclose to you the following: (i) the categories of Personal Information that Citi has collected about you; (ii) the categories of sources from which Citi has collected Personal Information about you; (iii) the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your Personal Information; (iv) the categories of Personal Information that Citi has sold about you in the last 12 months and the categories of Third Parties to whom the Personal Information was sold, by category or categories of Personal Information for each Third Party to whom the Personal Information was sold; (v) the categories of Personal Information that Citi has disclosed about you for our business purposes in the last 12 months and the categories of Third Parties to whom the Personal Information was disclosed, by category or categories of Personal Information for each Third Party to whom the Personal Information was disclosed; and (vi) the specific pieces of Personal Information that Citi has collected about you.  Please note that Personal Information we have collected in connection with your personal account with us is not subject to the requirements of CCPA because it is already protected under existing federal and California state privacy laws, including the Graham Leach Bliley Act.   
								</li><li>You have the right to request a portable copy of your Personal Information.  <br><br>  
									In response to verified requests pursuant to #1 or #2 above, we will disclose and deliver the required information to you free of charge within 45 days of receiving a verifiable consumer request.  We may extend this time period to provide once by an additional 45 days when reasonably necessary.  We will provide notice of the extension within the first 45-day period.   
								</li><li>You have the right to request that Citi delete Personal Information collected from you, subject to certain exceptions allowed under applicable law.

CCPA defines sale very broadly, covering both monetary and other consideration.  Citi does not sell personal information for money.  However, we share some types of personal information.  See our <a href="https://online.citi.com/dataprivacyhub" title="https://online.citi.com/dataprivacyhub" target="_new">Privacy Hub</a>.
								</li><li>Citi will not discriminate against you because you elect to exercise these rights, including by:
									<ul style="font-size: 1em; list-style: disc;">
										<li>Denying goods or services to you.
										</li><li>Charging you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties.
										</li><li>Providing a different level or quality of goods or services to you.
										</li><li>Suggesting that you will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
									</li></ul>
							</li></ol>
							<p>None of the foregoing, however, prohibits Citi from charging you a different price or rate, or from providing a different level or quality of goods or services to you, if that difference is reasonably related to the value provided to Citi by your data.</p>

							<p><b>Submission of Requests; Authorized Representatives</b></p>
							<p>You may exercise these rights by managing this information through your online account on Citi's Privacy Hub at <a href="https://online.citi.com/dataprivacyhub" title="https://online.citi.com/dataprivacyhub" target="_new">online.citi.com/dataprivacyhub</a> or by calling us at (833) 971-1191.  If you wish to submit a request to have your Personal Information deleted (see section 3 in this "Supplemental provision applicable to users registering from California" Appendix) or wish to opt-out of the selling of your Personal Information, call us at 833-399-0014. </p>

Upon receiving a request pursuant to #1 or #2 above, we will confirm receipt within 10 days and provide you with information about how we will verify and process the request.

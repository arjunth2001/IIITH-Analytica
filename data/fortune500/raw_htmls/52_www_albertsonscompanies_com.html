<h4 id="3.3">3.3. Text Messaging Services</h4>
<p>When you sign up for one of our text messaging programs, you are expressly consenting to receive text messages on your cell phone or other mobile device about our products, Services, and/or programs which may be sent by automated means. Text messages will only be sent to the mobile phone number used to opt into the applicable text message program. Some programs may send you up to the specified number of messages per month, dependent on the program, and each program in which you enroll will increase the total number of messages you receive each month. Details on how many messages you should expect to receive are provided at the time of enrollment. In some instances, you may have the opportunity to reply to a message, which may result in additional response messages. Your consent to enrollment in any text message program is not a condition of purchase. For information about a text message program you may text HELP to the applicable short code.</p>
<p>Message and data rates may apply. This means that your carrier may charge you for each message we send to you or that you send to us. It is your responsibility to know whether your carrier will charge you a per-message fee.

You will receive a final confirmation message that will confirm that you will no longer receive text messages from the applicable text message program unless you opt back into such program. Different instructions may apply to health care text messages related to our pharmacy Services.</p>
<h4 id="3.4">3.4. Loyalty Programs</h4>
<p>As part of our Services, we also offer loyalty programs that, individually or in combination with each other, use information to provide rewards and/or provide exclusive discounts or offers to program participants. The program details below provide important information about participants’ rights and obligations in Company-sponsored loyalty programs. All programs may not be available in all areas, and program functionality may vary by geographic location. All participants are bound to these program details.</p>
<p>Certain Company divisions and/or select locations may run limited-time promotions offering additional single purchase and/or cumulative rewards. Where offered, these promotions may be subject to additional or different advertised terms.</p>
<p><span class="loyality">Loyalty Program Participation</span><br>
Participation in one or more of our loyalty programs is open, where offered, to everyone over the age of 13 who signs up or otherwise chooses to participate. Though registration may be required for participation in some of our programs, membership is not considered to be exclusive to the registered individual and multiple people are permitted to use a single membership account. For instance, participants are free to share their membership number or other account information with family and friends to receive in-store discounts and collectively earn and use Points and redeem special offers. For this reason, information collected through our loyalty programs is not attributable to any individual or household.</p>
<p><span class="loyality">Special Promotions</span><br>
We may make special offers available to loyalty program participants from time to time. If applicable, the terms and conditions for such special offers will be disclosed at the time of the offer or promotion. Please review those terms and conditions carefully, as there may be important conditions or limitations. Availability of any special offer is subject to change without notice.</p>
<p><span class="loyality">Communications</span><br>
We may contact loyalty program participants regarding any matter related to the Program. These Program communications may be in addition to general marketing which you may receive from us. Even if a participant opts out of marketing communications, the account may still continue to receive relationship/operational communications related to the Program.</p>
<p><span class="loyality">General Terms</span><br>
Participation in a loyalty program and its benefits are offered at our sole discretion and may vary from brand to brand and location to location. We may change a loyalty program, including any special promotions, benefits, or these program details at any time and for any reason. We also reserve the right to alter loyalty program benefits and special promotions based on account activity, volume or purchases, geographic location, or other non-discriminatory factors. We can delay enforcing our rights under a loyalty program without losing them. In addition, our failure to exercise rights on any one occasion, or even on more than one occasion, does not constitute a waiver of our rights for any future occasion. All waivers must be in writing. Participants are solely liable for any applicable federal, state or local income, sales, use, or other taxes arising out of the accrual or use of Points or Rewards.</p>
<h5>Club Card</h5>
This program allows participants to receive instant advertised discounts on in-store purchases at participating locations. To activate the discounts, the participant must either swipe or scan a membership card or enter a 10-digit phone number in the pin pad during checkout. Participants who enter a cell phone number that is not linked to a just for U® account may receive one or more invitations by text to register for just for U to earn Points and redeem offers on Club Card purchases and otherwise combine program benefits where available.<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>just for U<sup>®</sup></h5>
This program allows participants to earn Points for every dollar spent on eligible purchases while also receiving offers for additional discounts on specified products at participating locations simply for using a valid Program account. Points are accumulated to earn Rewards that may be redeemed on future gas or grocery purchases as described below. To participate you must register online or through our mobile application or obtain consent to use the existing account information of another registered participant.<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="loyality">Earning Points and Rewards</span><br>
One Point will be awarded for each whole dollar spent on eligible grocery and pharmacy purchases and two Points will be earned for each whole dollar spent on eligible gift card purchases. For example, if you spend $5.25 in a participating Company store on groceries while using a valid Program account, you will earn 5 Points. Each 100 Points earned within a calendar month is converted into one Reward.</p>
<p>Eligible purchases exclude: (1) beer, wine and tobacco (and spirits in certain states); (2) fuel and automotive services; (3) bus passes, commuter passes, fishing or hunting licenses, ski passes, postage stamps, lottery tickets, amusement park passes, and event tickets; (4) any financial instrument that can be redeemed for goods or Services at participating Company stores - including (but not limited to) financial services (Western Union), gift certificates/cards, money orders, and credit or debit cards issued by MasterCard®, Visa®, NetSpend®, etc.; (5) mobile phone cards; (6) all fuel partner gift cards; and (7) all fluid items in the refrigerated dairy section—including fluid dairy substitutes. Sales tax payments and redemption value deposits are not purchases and are not eligible to earn Points. For pharmacy purchases, only out-of-pocket costs (e.g., prescription co-pays) are eligible to earn Points.</p>
<p><span class="loyality">Tracking Account Status</span><br>
Account details, such as Points earned, can be tracked by logging into the registered account through our mobile apps or websites or by reviewing the receipt from the account’s most recent transaction.</p>
<p><span class="loyality">Redeeming Rewards for Gas or Groceries</span><br>
For Gas Rewards, one Reward equals 10 cents off per gallon. Gas Rewards savings in a single transaction are limited (i) to 25 gallons (20 gallons in Jewel-Osco) for one vehicle per transaction––subject to rounding for applicable in-store fuel transactions and (ii) to the maximum per-gallon Gas Rewards discount at participating stations (usually 20 cents per gallon) and $1.00 off per gallon at participating Company stations. To find a participating station, <a href="https://local.safeway.com/search.html">click here.</a> To use Gas Rewards, you must establish eligibility before pumping fuel. Gas Rewards will be available for use at participating fuel retailers approximately one hour after being earned. Gas Rewards may only be redeemed at participating fuel stations.</p>
<p>Grocery Rewards may be used only in the stores that offer such rewards (e.g., if offered by our Southern California Vons stores, Grocery Rewards items must be redeemed and picked up at Vons locations in Southern California). Once you elect to apply earned Rewards toward a Grocery Rewards offer and confirm your selection, the applicable Rewards are deducted from your Account and cannot be used for another Grocery Reward offer or for Gas Rewards or be reinstated in any way. You may claim your redeemed Grocery Rewards item through the end of the following calendar month (e.g., Grocery Rewards items redeemed and confirmed in April are available to pick up through the end of May).</p>
<p>There may be a lag between the time when you redeem your Rewards and when your Rewards balance is updated. Attempting to reuse Rewards that have already been applied may result in a negative Rewards balance until you accumulate enough Rewards to eliminate such deficit.</p>
<p><span class="loyality">Rewards and Points Expiration</span><br>
Rewards earned during each calendar month may be used only until the end of the following calendar month, after which such Rewards expire (Rewards earned in January, for example, expire at the end of February). Moreover, any remaining Point totals less than 100 Points expire at the end of each calendar month.</p>

<h4>California Consumer Privacy Rights</h4>
<p>California residents have the right to request that we disclose the categories of personal information collected; the categories of sources from which personal information is collected; the business or commercial purpose; the categories of third parties with which the businesses shares personal information, and the specific pieces of information we hold about you (subject to specified limitations).</p>
<p>Similarly, California residents can request that we delete certain pieces of their personal information. While California law also allows for California residents to opt out of the sale of their personal information, the Company does not “sell” personal information as those terms are defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act.</p>
<p>To submit a request, you may contact us as specified in the <a href="#9">“How to Contact Us”</a> section of the Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>After you (or an agent which you authorize) submit a request to access or delete your personal information, we are required to “verify” your request to ensure that the request is not fraudulent. Thus, upon receiving your request we will take measures to verify that the request is legitimate. These verification efforts may require additional information from you which may include information you have provided us in the past. For instance, if you have previously provided your name to us, we may ask you for other information (e.g., last four digits of your credit card, email address, phone number) so that we can match the new information you provide with the information we have. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate. If through reasonable efforts we are unable to verify your request to a reasonable degree of certainty, we will notify you.</p>
<p>Note you can authorize an agent to exercise any of these California privacy rights on your behalf. Note that we will take additional measures to verify the legal authority of your agent.</p>
<p>California residents also have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of any of the privacy rights conferred by the California Consumer Privacy Act as described in this Section.</p>
<p>For further details on California residents’ privacy rights see Cal Civil Codes §§ 1798.80-83.</p>

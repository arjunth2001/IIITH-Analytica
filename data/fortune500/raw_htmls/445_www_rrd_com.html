<p>RRD complies with the EU-U.S Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss–U.S Privacy Shield Framework (Privacy Shield) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) and/or Switzerland (as applicable) to the United States in reliance on Privacy Shield. RRD has certified to the Department of Commerce that is adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such information. If there is any conflict between the terms of this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit the Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield Website at <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>.</p>
<p>RRD may obtain in the US the following types of EU, UK and Swiss information: name, address, invoice information including bank account information, and order information (“EU, UK and Swiss Business Contact Information”). RRD uses EU, UK and Swiss Business Contact Information for the following purposes: managing customer relationships, managing orders, tracking payments and ensuring payment, and otherwise maintaining the customer relationship. RRD may disclose EU, UK and Swiss Business Contact Information to its affiliates, subsidiaries, business partners, and service providers for the purposes listed above.</p>
<p>In situations where RRD discloses (i.e. onward transfers) EU, UK and Swiss Business Contact Information to any third parties acting as service providers or "agents" on behalf of RRD, RRD will require the recipient to protect the disclosed EU, UK and Swiss Business Contact Information in accordance with the relevant Privacy Shield Principles, or otherwise take steps to ensure that the EU, UK and Swiss Business Contact Information is appropriately protected. With respect to any sharing of EU, UK and Swiss Business Contact Information for the purposes of marketing RRD products and services, RRD obtains guarantees from its affiliates, subsidiaries and business partners that such entities will use and disclose such EU, UK and Swiss Business Contact Information for purposes of marketing RRD products and services only. In cases of onward transfer of EU, UK or Swiss Business Information to third parties pursuant to Privacy Shield, RRD is potentially liable in the event of an improper disclosure. In certain situations, individuals may seek to opt-out of disclosures of their EU, UK and Swiss Business Contact Information by contacting RRD as specified in the “Contacting RRD” section below.</p>
<p>RRD takes appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard EU, UK and Swiss personal data against unauthorized or unlawful processing of, or accidental loss, damage, misuse, unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized alteration, or destruction, and maintains reasonable procedures to help ensure that such information is relevant for its intended use, accurate, complete, current and not excessive and that such information is not retained longer than is reasonably necessary.</p>
<p>With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, RRD is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the United States Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, RRD may disclose EU, UK and Swiss personal data as necessary in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of its business, where required or permitted by law, where RRD believes that such disclosures are appropriate in connection with a law enforcement request or as otherwise permitted by the Privacy Shield Principles, or in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud or in order to comply with, enforce or apply RRD agreements.</p>
<p>European Union, UK and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should contact the RRD Privacy Shield point of contact - at <strong>DataPrivacy@rrd.com</strong>. RRD will respond to your inquiry within 45 days.</p>
<p>In the event of a reported complaint that RRD does not resolve itself, RRD commits to cooperate with the EU Data Protection Authorities (DPA’s) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) and comply with the advice given by the EU DPA panel or Swiss Commissioner with regard to human resource and non-human resource data transferred from the EU,UK and Switzerland to RRD in the United States (US).</p>
<p>Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website [<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint</a>], you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.</p>

<p>RRD operates as a data processor for our business customers located in the US, EU, UK and other geographic locations worldwide. RRD's business customers remain the data controllers with respect to any Customer data that they provide to RRD for our provision of services.

<h3>If You Are An RRD MOTIF Customer</h3>

<h4>Controller or Processor</h4>
<p>We are considered controllers of your personal data that you share with us. This is because we decide the reasons for collecting, holding and using your data. We also decide the ways in which we process your data.</p>
<h4>The data we collect, hold or process</h4>
<p>We collect, store and use your contact details, such as name, telephone number and email addresses as well as billing and shipping address. You will also create login credentials to our service so you can track your order and view your order history</p>
<p>Data related to your usage of the MOTIF web site or iOS app, such as IP address, may be collected for performance, functionality or marketing/advertising purposes, which are set out in the Cookie Policy accessed through a link on the front page of the MOTIF web site or through the cookie pop-up on the MOTIF web site</p>
<h4>Special categories of data</h4>
<p>We do not collect or hold any personal data relating to your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or biometric data for the purposes of uniquely identifying you, data concerning your health, sex life or sexual orientation.</p>
<p>We do not hold any information related to your children unless you have included photographs of them in your project to be converted into a printed photographic product.</p>
<h4>Why we collect, hold or process your personal data</h4>
<p>This data was either given to us by you so you can be kept up-to-date with news about the MOTIF app, or you passed it to us so we can convert your photographic images into a photobook, calendar or card; or it was collected with your permission when you visited our website.</p>
<h4>Why we are permitted to collect, hold or process your personal data</h4>
<p>You have either asked us to keep you up to date with news about the MOTIF app or you wish us to create a photographic product with your data, or you chose to share this information with us when you visited our website.</p>
<h4>What would happen if we cannot hold your data</h4>
<p>It would not be possible to keep you up to date with news about the MOTIF application and it would not be possible to create and send the completed photobook, calendar or card to you.</p>
<h4>How long we keep your data for</h4>
<p>Our default position is only to keep personal data for as long as is necessary for us to perform the service for you, in this case, printing photographic products and/or keeping you up to date about the MOTIF app.</p>
<p>We will contact you periodically with news about MOTIF until you tell us you do not need this information any more by unsubscribing from any emails we send you.</p>
<p>Unless you specifically tell us otherwise we will hold your order history for 24 months after the date of your last order in case you wish to review your order history. Your photographic products will be held for 60 days in our repository in case you wish to order a reprint. Your finished photographic product will be held for 21 days at the facilities where they are printed in case there is a quality issue or delivery failure and we need to reprint the product for you.</p>
<p>Periodically, and at least annually, we will carry out a data cleansing exercise to remove any data where messages may have failed or where we believe the data is no longer relevant e.g. through changes in the MOTIF service.</p>
<h4>Automated decision making or profiling of you</h4>
<p>We do not use your personal data to profile you or to make any automated decisions about you.</p>
<h4>Suppliers we use</h4>
<p>We use a number of suppliers to help us maintain our interactions with you.</p>
<p>If one of our suppliers has access to and processes your personal data we will check that the supplier keeps your data confidential, has the processes and technology in place to keep your personal data secure and does not use your data for any reason other than in accordance with the set of processing instructions we have agreed with them.</p>
<p>We also make sure that the supplier does not transfer your data internationally without the required permission and legal frameworks in place.</p>
<p>All the necessary privacy requirements will be put in place through the contracts between us and our suppliers to allow them to hold and process your personal data.</p>
<p>Below are the list of suppliers that may process your personal data as part of your relationship with RR Donnelley through the MOTIF app.</p>

<h4>Other countries your data may be transferred to</h4>
<p>We are a global organisation and this means some of our systems and offices are located around the world.</p>
<p>As not every country has the same rules and regulations about the privacy of your data we make sure that when we transfer your personal details outside of the European Union (EU) (or wider European Economic Area (EEA)) we protect your data appropriately.</p>
<p>As a business, RRD is part of the Privacy Shield framework (<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>) which was designed by the European Commission, the Federal Administration of Switzerland and the United States of America (USA) Department of Commerce to protect the personal data and the rights of individuals within the EU, the United Kingdom (UK) and Switzerland if their personal data is transferred to the USA.</p>
<p>You can review our Privacy Shield certification at the following site by searching for RR Donnelley <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/list" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/list</a>. We also have further information on our Privacy Shield certification in the Privacy section of the main RR Donnelley website (<a href="https://www.rrd.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank">https://www.rrd.com/privacy-policy)</a>.</p>
<p>If we transfer your personal data to a supplier located within the USA we also require that supplier to be Privacy Shield certified, the same as us; or we put in place Standard Contractual Clauses (also called Model Clauses or Data Transfer Agreements) between ourselves (RRD) and the organisation or business that is receiving that data.</p>
<p>If we transfer your personal data to another country outside of the EEA we first check whether the EU Commission has made a finding of adequacy in respect to their privacy laws before we make that transfer. Failing that, we put in place Standard Contractual Clauses (also called Model Clauses or Data Transfer Agreements) between ourselves (RRD) and the organisation or business that is receiving that data.</p>

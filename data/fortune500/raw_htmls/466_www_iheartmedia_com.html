                            <p>We (and the vendors we hire to perform business functions on our behalf) and third parties who have integrated their technologies into our platforms and services may collect, receive, and develop several categories of personal information about you depending on the nature of your interactions with us:</p>

You may create a personal iHeartRadio Code by enabling this feature through the settings in the Apps; the iHeartRadio Code is connected to a unique identifier that ties back to your iHeartRadio account and the information associated with your account. You may also submit photos and videos.</p>

If you apply for a job, you can choose to also voluntarily provide any of the following self-identifying information: ethnicity, gender, disability status, and/or veteran status.</p>

                            <p><strong><em>Payment Information: </em></strong>We collect your credit card or debit card details when you make a purchase.</p>

                            <p><strong><em>We develop Inferences:</em></strong> Using the other pieces of personal information collected about you, we draw inferences about you, reflecting what we believe to be your interests, characteristics, predispositions, and attitudes.</p>

                            <p>Choices you make are device-specific and browser-specific.If you use different browsers on your computer, or multiple computers and Devices, you will need to opt out of IBA from each browser on each of the computers and Devices that you use.

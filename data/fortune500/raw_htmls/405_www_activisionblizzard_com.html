</p>
<p>Without being discriminated against for exercising these rights, California residents have the right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect from you, to delete that information, and to opt-out of the sale of your personal information, subject to certain restrictions. You also have the right to designate an agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. This section describes how to exercise those rights and our process for handling those requests.</p>
<p><b>Right to Request Access to Your Personal Information</b></p>
<p>California residents have the right to request, up to two times in a 12-month period, that we disclose what categories of your personal information that we collect, use, and share. You may also request the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected from you. Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under California law.</p>
<p><b>Right to&nbsp;Request Deletion of Your Personal Information</b></p>
<p>You may also request that we delete personal information that we collected from you. Some information may be exempt from such requests under California law. For example, we need certain types of information so that we can provide our Properties to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use our Properties.</p>
<p><b>How to Exercise Your Access and Deletion Rights</b></p>
<p>California residents may exercise their California privacy rights by submitting your request to us <a href="https://support.activision.com/privacy" target="_blank">here</a> or sending an email to <a href="mailto:ccparequests@activisionblizzard.com">ccparequests@activisionblizzard.com</a>.</p>
<p>For security purposes, we will verify your identity – including requesting information from you – when you request to exercise your California privacy rights. If you have an online account you use to interact with Activision, logging into your account will serve to verify your identity and request. We may request additional information if we believe your account has been compromised. If you do not have an account with us, or if we have reason to suspect that the security of your account is compromised, then we will request additional information from you to match with our existing records to verify your identity, depending on the nature of the request and the sensitivity of the information sought.</p>
<p>Once we have verified your identity (and your agent, as applicable), we will respond to your request as appropriate. If we are unable to complete your requests, we will provide you information about the reasons that we could not comply with your request.</p>
<p><b>Right to Nondiscrimination</b></p>
<p>We will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level of quality of goods or services if you choose to exercise these rights.</p>
<p><b>Sale of Personal Information</b></p>
<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), gives California residents the right to opt out of the sale of personal information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our data sharing practices are set forth above. We do not believe that these activities are sales of your personal information. We do not sell information that directly identifies you such as your name, telephone number, mailing address or email address. We also do not provide customer personal information to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration.</p>
<p>We support the CCPA by allowing California residents to opt out of any other future sale of their personal information.&nbsp;If you would like to record your preference that Activision Blizzard not sell your data in the future, please click <a></a><a href="https://www.activisionblizzard.com/legal/ccpa" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;You can also submit a sale opt-out request by emailing us at <a href="mailto:ccparequests@activisionblizzard.com">ccparequests@activisionblizzard.com</a>.</p>
<p><b>Authorized Agents</b></p>
<p>You may also designate an agent to make requests to exercise your rights under the CCPA as described above. We will take steps both to verify the identity of the person seeking to exercise their rights as listed above, and to verify that your agent has been authorized to make a request on your behalf through providing us with a signed written authorization or a copy of a power of attorney.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>California Shine the Light Law</b></p>
<p>Since 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not share our customer's personal information with unaffiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. For inquiries regarding our disclosure policy, please send us an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@activisionblizzard.com">privacy@activisionblizzard.com</a>, or write us at: Activision Publishing, Inc., 3100 Ocean Park Boulevard, Santa Monica, CA 90405 USA, ATTN: Privacy Team/Privacy Policy. We will be happy to honor your request.</p>
<p><b>California Privacy Rights for Minor Users</b></p>
<p>Since January 1, 2015, California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits you, if you are a California resident under the age of 18, to view, correct, or delete information provided by you or publicly posted by you, by sending us an email asking us to delete certain posted content at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@activision.com">privacy@activisionblizzard.com</a>. In the alternative, you may write to us at Activision Publishing, Inc., 3100 Ocean Park Boulevard, Santa Monica, CA 90405 USA, ATTN: Privacy Team/Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We will be happy to review, update or remove Information and/or content as appropriate. Residual copies of Information and/or content that have been removed from your account and/or the Properties may remain in our backup systems for approximately one month. We may still retain your Information to resolve disputes, enforce our user agreement, or comply with legal requirements; in this case, your personal information will be blocked from use for any other purpose.</p>
<p><b>Do Not Track</b></p>
<p>California Business and Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) permits our customers who are California residents to be informed as to how Activision Blizzard responds to Web browser "Do Not Track" settings. As Do Not Track is a standard that is currently being developed, Activision Blizzard does not take actions to respond to Do Not Track settings, and instead we adhere to the standards set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>These Cookies allow the website or online property to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features.

<p>Activision Blizzard may partner with third party online advertising and analytics companies to tailor and deliver advertisements, products, services, and promotions on our Properties, as well as other online properties which we do not control.

In some instances, third-parties may also use cookies or similar technologies to collect anonymized or device-related information about your visits to the Properties in order to&nbsp;monitor the effectiveness of the ads (e.g., by using analytics Cookies) and to provide third party advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.</p>

<p>From time to time, we may use web beacons (or clear GIFs) on our Properties or include them in the email messages we send you. Web beacons (also known as "web bugs",&nbsp;"pixel tags" or&nbsp;"pixels") are small strings of code that provide a method of delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data. We use web beacons for many purposes, including site traffic reporting, unique visitor counts, advertising and email auditing and reporting, and personalization. We also keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer when you log on to the Internet.&nbsp;For example, we may use these in emails to understand and analyze whether the email was opened or any links were clicked, in order to improve our future communications with you and other users. As a web beacon forms part of a webpage or email it does not have the same opt out options as other Cookies. Generally, you can render them ineffective by opting out of any Cookies they set, by turning off images in your email service, or by viewing your emails as “text” rather than “HTML.” For more information on how to opt out of Cookies see the <a href="#holder_30">Managing Cookies and Do Not Track Options</a> section below, and for more information on how to turn off images in your emails or to view them as text see the “Help” section of your email service provider.</p>

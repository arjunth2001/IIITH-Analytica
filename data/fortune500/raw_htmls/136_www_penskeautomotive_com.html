You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.  In California, a minor is defined as any person under the age of 18 years.</p>\n                    <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>\n                    <ul class=\"discc\">\n                        <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>\n                        <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>\n                    </ul>\n                    <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.

We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt.  If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.  We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.  Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt.  The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.  For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>\n                    <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request.

We require these third parties to keep your personally identifiable information secure in accordance with federal and state legal requirements, such as the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, where applicable. We may use and disclose some or all of the information in accordance with applicable law as follows:</p>
            <p style="padding-left:20px;"><b>Service Providers/Marketing Partners –</b> We may provide information to third parties to assist in servicing accounts, administering and enforcing accounts, providing services to our dealerships or our customers and responding to customer inquiries.  Our dealerships also may use marketing and other firms to assist in our own marketing efforts.  These third party service providers may use customer information to perform contracted services at our request. Our dealerships require these third parties to keep your personally identifiable information secure in accordance with federal and other applicable requirements, and our contracts with these third parties require that your information be used only to perform the contracted services as required by applicable law.</p>
            <p style="padding-left:20px;"><b>Assignment/Others –</b> We are required to report sales transactions and provide vehicle related information to our manufacturer partners and government agencies.  In addition, we may buy and sell assets or businesses such as automobile dealerships.  When this occurs, customer information generally is transferred to the acquirer.  In the event that we buy and/or sell assets or businesses, or undergo a corporate re-organization, you grant us the right to assign the information we have collected from you.  We also disclose information about you to third parties in certain other circumstances, as permitted by law, or to process a transaction requested by you.</p>
            <p style="padding-left:20px;"><b>Audits/Judicial Proceedings –</b> We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when one of our dealerships believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our dealership rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process served on our dealerships.</p>

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard non-public personal information about you.  However, no security measures can be 100% secure, so we recommend that you take additional measures to protect yourself and your information, including by installing up to date anti-virus software, closing browsers after use, keeping your log-in credentials and passwords confidential, and making sure that you regularly update software and apps you have downloaded to ensure you have enabled the latest security features on your devices.</p>
            <p id="california">Furthermore, once the information has been received by us, we use reasonable security procedures and policies commensurate with industry standards to safeguard against loss, theft, unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification and/or disclosure.</p>

                    <span>YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES</span>
                    <p>The CCPA provides consumers who are California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</p>
                    <p>You have the right to know and request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months from the date of your request. Once we receive and verify your consumer request, we will disclose to you:</p>
                    <ul class="discc">
                        <li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
                        <li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>

                        <li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>
                        <li>The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Deletion Request Rights</p>
                    <p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.  Once we receive and verify your consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>
                    <p>We may retain your personal information even if you request deletion if we can’t verify your identity or if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:</p>
                    <ul style="margin-bottom:25px;">
                        <li style="list-style:decimal">Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.</li>
                        <li style="list-style:decimal">Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.</li>
                        <li style="list-style:decimal">Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</li>
                        <li style="list-style:decimal">Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.</li>
                        <li style="list-style:decimal">Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.).</li>
                        <li style="list-style:decimal">Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.</li>
                        <li style="list-style:decimal">Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.</li>
                        <li style="list-style:decimal">Comply with a legal obligation or if the information was collected, processed or disclosed pursuant to another law and is specifically exempted by CCPA.</li>
                        <li style="list-style:decimal">Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</p>
                    <p>We make available to California residents two designated methods for submitting requests to exercise access, data portability, and deletion rights of your personal information. Should you wish to exercise these rights, please view your local Penske Automotive Group dealership privacy policy and review the CCPA Individual Rights section. You will then be able to submit a request through the web intake form or phone number posted on the specific dealership website. To find a list of our dealerships please visit our <a href="https://www.penskeautomotive.com/CustomPage/Index?KeyGenPage=429675">location list</a>.</p>
                    <p>Only you or your authorized agent (i.e., a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf) may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.  In California, a minor is defined as any person under the age of 18 years.</p>
                    <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
                    <ul class="discc">
                        <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
                        <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</p>

                    <p style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">How we verify your request for personal information</p>
                    <p>In order to access or delete your personal information, you must submit a request that we can verify.  We take important steps to ensure that the individual requesting the information is indeed the person whose personal information that our company is being asked to take action on.  Ways in which we will request verification include:</p>
                    <ul class="discc">
                        <li>Verifying your email address with the address that is on record with our company.</li>
                        <li>Verifying phone information that has previously been associated with you.</li>
                        <li>Sending a communication to the data subject at the email address that we have on file previously associated with you.</li>
                        <li>If needed, we may contact you personally to review additional information should we not be able to verify you by the data provided.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">Response Timing and Format</p>
                    <p>Upon our receipt of a consumer request, you will receive confirmation of our receipt of the request.   We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt.  If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.  We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.  Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt.  The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.  For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
                    <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request. The law allows you to make 2 requests within a 12 month period.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>NON-DISCRIMINATION</span>
                    <p>We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your CCPA rights.  For that reason, we will not:</p>
                    <ul class="discc">
                        <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
                        <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>

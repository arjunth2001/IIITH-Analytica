                <p>We may collect information about you in various ways.</p>
<ul>
    <li>You may provide us with information directly (e.g. filling in a form, or making a call to us).</li>
    <li>We may collect information automatically (e.g. when you use a PMI app or website).</li>
    <li>We may acquire information from third parties (e.g. publicly-available information on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter).</li>
</ul>
<p>In this notice, we refer to all the methods by which you are in contact with us as “<em>PMI</em> <em>touchpoints</em>”. PMI touchpoints include both physical (for example, retail outlets and events), and digital (for example, apps and websites).</p>

    <li>attend an event that a PMI affiliate has organised.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may collect information about you automatically. Typically this will happen when you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>visit an outlet that sells PMI products (e.g. by collecting your data at check-out, or through sensors at the outlet that connect with mobile technology);</li>
    <li>attend an event that a PMI affiliate has organised (e.g. through purchases at the event or through sensors at the event that connect with mobile technology);</li>
    <li>communicate with us (for example, through a touchpoint; or social media platforms);</li>
    <li>use PMI touchpoints (e.g. through tracking mechanisms in an app or a website); or</li>
    <li>make public posts on social media platforms that we follow (for example, so that we can understand public opinion, or respond to requests concerning PMI products).</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also collect information about you automatically through the use of cookies and similar tracking technologies on digital PMI touchpoints. The specific cookies and technologies used will depend on the PMI touchpoint in question.

</ul>
<br>
<p>Information that we collect from third parties will generally consist of publicly-available profile information (such as your preferences and interests), for example from public social media posts.</p>

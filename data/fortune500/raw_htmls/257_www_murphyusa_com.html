Our Terms of Use are incorporated by reference into this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Murphy USA reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please revisit this page occasionally to check for updates.

<p><strong>HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p><strong>Third-Party Providers</strong>. We may make some content, products, and services available on the Website, the App, and at Murphy USA retail locations through cooperative relationships with third-party providers, and the brands of these third-party providers may appear on the Website, in the App, or at Murphy USA retail locations in connection with the content, products, or services. We may share with these third-party providers any information that you provide or that is collected in the course of visiting any pages or accessing or purchasing any products or services that are made available in cooperation with our third-party providers. Third-party providers include product manufacturers, suppliers, and vendors with which Murphy USA does business.</p>
<p>We may also share information in the following circumstances:</p>
<p><strong>Business Transfers</strong>. If we are acquired by or merged with another company, if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another company, or if the company’s assets are reorganized or liquidated as part of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, we may transfer the information that we have collected from you to the other company.</p>

<p>Aggregate and De-Identified Information. We may share aggregate or de-identified information about users with third parties for marketing, advertising, research, or similar purposes.</p>
<p><strong>LINKS FROM OUR SITE TO OTHER SITES</strong></p>
<p>Some pages on the Website or the App may contain links to external sites and may provide access to products and services offered by third parties. When you access these external websites, or access products or services from a third party, the providers of these external websites, products, or services will have access to certain information about you. Murphy USA does not control the information collection practices or the privacy practices of the providers of external websites. Murphy USA is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any websites that we do not directly control.</p>
<p><strong>COOKIES, WEB BEACONS, &amp; OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong>. We use cookies to enhance your experience with the Website. Cookies are small pieces of program code that reside on your computer. By showing how and when visitors use the Website, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users visit the Website, and track user interests, trends, and patterns, all of which helps us make the Website more useful. Cookies may also prevent you from having to re-enter your contactor preference information as you navigate to the Website.</p>
<p>You can opt-out of the use of cookies by having your browser disable cookies or warn you before accepting a cookie. Look for the cookie options in your browser in the options or preferences menu. If you disable cookies in your browser, however, you may not be able to take advantage of some of the features or functions of the Website or products and services available through the Website.</p>
<p><strong>Web Beacons</strong>. The Website and the App may also use web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also known as transparent GIFs) to access cookies and to count users who visit the Website or use the App. Web beacons are small, transparent graphics that are placed on web and App pages to track the activities of Website visitors and App users to help us manage content and compile statistics about Website and App usage. We and our third-party service providers also use web beacons in HTML emails to our users, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Analytics</strong>. We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of the Website, and to the extent possible, the App. We may also use other analytic means to evaluate the Website and the App. We use these tools to help us improve our services, performance, and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. To learn more about Google Analytics and how it collects and processes data, please visit Google Privacy &amp; Terms.</p>
<p><strong>Do-Not-Track</strong>. Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (such as by disabling cookies) or use the opt-outs described in the Third-Party Ad Networks section below.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Ad Networks</strong>. We use third parties, such as network advertisers, to serve advertisements on third‑party websites or other media (such as social networking platforms). This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors, and traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, or other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third parties govern their use of cookies and other technologies through their own privacy policies. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information, including personally identifiable information, about you.</p>
<p>Users in the United States may opt-out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Choice Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by DAA companies. You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by NAI members.</p>
<p>Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page or the NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to You, but it does not mean that you will no longer receive any advertising through the Website, the App, or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the websites that you view (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt-out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt-out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the DAA’s website at www.aboutads.info and on the NAI’s website at www.networkadvertising.org.</p>
<p><strong>SECURITY OF MY PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We have implemented reasonable precautions to protect the information that we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee security.</p>
<p>You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, cell phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any unauthorized activity on your account.</p>
<p><strong>SPECIAL INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS</strong></p>
<p>California residents may request a list of certain third parties to which we have disclosed personally identifiable information about you for their own direct marketing purposes. You may make one request per calendar year. In your request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for your response. You may request this information in writing by contacting us at: Murphy USA Legal Department, 200 Peach Street El Dorado, Arkansas 71730 or at <a href="mailto:legal@murphyusa.com">legal@murphyusa.com</a>. Please allow up to 30 days for a response.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE REGARDING PROMOTIONAL EMAILS?</strong></p>
<p>We may send periodic promotional emails to you. You may opt-out of these emails by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information that we think may interest you, we may still send you emails about your account or any Services that you have requested or received from us.</p>
<p><strong>HOW YOU CAN CONTACT US OR UPDATE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>You may contact us or update your information by calling Murphy USA at 1-800-843-4298 or by emailing <a href="mailto:customercare@murphyusa.com">customercare@murphyusa.com</a>.

<p><strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION, ARBITRATION, &amp; CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Please read this provision carefully. It affects your legal rights.</strong></p>
<p>This Dispute Resolution, Arbitration, and Class Action Waiver provision (this “Provision”) facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any dispute (e.g., claim or controversy, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, and negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, including the validity, enforceability, and scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause)) that may arise between you and Murphy USA. In these Terms, “dispute” has the broadest meaning allowable by law, and includes all claims against third parties (such as our licensors, suppliers, dealers, or vendors) relating to these Terms, the Services, the Materials, and any Promotion (as promotion is defined in the Murphy USA Terms of Use) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.</p>
<p>This Provision provides that all disputes between you and us will be resolved by binding arbitration. Acceptance of these Terms constitutes a waiver of your right to litigation claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or a jury.</p>
<p>To be clear, there is no judge or jury in arbitration and judicial review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this Provision and can award the same damages and relief (including attorney’s fees) that a court is permitted to award. You may, however, opt-out of this Provision. If done, you would have the right or the opportunity to bring claims in court, before a judge or a jury, or to participate in or to be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions). BOTH YOU AND MURPHY USA AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</strong>.<strong> </strong>For all Disputes, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve the Dispute. To do so, you must email the following information to <a href="mailto:legal@murphyusa.com">legal@murphyusa.com</a>: (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief that you are seeking. If we do not resolve the Dispute by the 60th day following the date on which we receive your notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration. You may pursue your Dispute in court only under the circumstances described below.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusions from Arbitration and Right to Opt-Out</strong>. Despite anything to the contrary above, you or we may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if: (a) the dispute qualifies for initiation in small claims court or (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES IN THESE TERMS BY THE 30TH DAY FOLLOWING THE DATE ON WHICH YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THESE TERMS (the “opt-out deadline”). You may opt-out of mandatory arbitration as described in this Provision by emailing the following information to <a href="mailto:legal@murphyusa.com">legal@murphyusa.com</a>: (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with us through arbitration. We promise that your decision to opt-out of this Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with us. But we do have to enforce the opt-out deadline. <strong>Any opt-out request received after the opt-out deadline will not be valid and you will be required to pursue any dispute in arbitration or in small claims court.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong>.<strong> </strong>If this Provision applies and the dispute is not resolved through the Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution process, either you or we may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) (www.adr.org) or JAMS (www.jamsadr.com) will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration will be an individual arbitration and will not be a class arbitration. All issues will be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Provision. For Disputes of less than $75,000 before the AAA, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply. For Disputes involving $75,000 or more before the AAA, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. In either instance, the AAA’s Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection will apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols for Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply. The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267. This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class or collective action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Because these Terms and the Services concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or conditions precedent to suit.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitration Award</strong>. The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that is available under applicable law, but the arbitrator may not award relief to, against, or for the benefit of any person or entity that is not a party to the arbitration. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested to do so by a party. Any arbitration award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>Location of Arbitration</strong>. You or we may initiate arbitration in either Arkansas or in the federal judicial district in which your physical address is located. We may transfer any arbitration to Arkansas, so long as we agree to pay any additional fees or costs that the arbitrator determines you have incurred because of the transfer.</p>
<p><strong>Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs</strong>. If you send us a written request prior to the initiation of the arbitration, we will pay all arbitration fees. You will still be responsible for all additional expenses and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including your attorney’s fees and fees for expert witnesses. In addition to any fees and costs recoverable under applicable law, if you comply with the Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution process and negotiate in good faith with us and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.</p>
<p><strong>Class Action Waiver</strong>. Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not preside over any form of a class, collective, or consolidated proceeding (such as a class action, consolidated action, or private attorney general action), unless both you and we specifically agree to do so following the initiation of the arbitration. <strong>If you choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out of this Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you.</strong> Neither you nor any other user of the Services can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, collective, or consolidated proceeding without having complied with the requirements to opt-out of this Provision.</p>
<p><strong>Jury Waiver</strong>. You understand and agree that by accepting this Provision, you and we are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court. In the absence of this Provision, you and we might otherwise have had the right or the opportunity to bring disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, or to participate or to be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions). Except as otherwise provided below, these rights are waived. Other rights that you would have if you went to court (such as the right to appellate review and to certain types of discovery) may be more limited or may also be waived.</p>
<p><strong>Severability</strong>.<strong> </strong>If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision and the remainder of this Provision will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continuation</strong>. This Provision will survive the termination of your account with us or our affiliates and your discontinued use of the Services and the Materials. We agree that if we make any change to this Provision (other than a change to the notice address), you may reject the change and require us to adhere to the language in this Provision if a dispute between you and us arises.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL</strong></p>
<p>We think that direct communication resolves most issues. If we feel that you are not complying with these Terms, we will tell you—and because we value this relationship, we will even provide you with recommended corrective action.</p>
<p>However, certain violations of these Terms, as determined by us, may require immediate termination of your access to the Services or the Materials. The Federal Arbitration Act, Arkansas law, and U.S. federal law will govern these Terms, without regard to choice or conflicts of laws principles that would require the application of any other laws. Foreign laws do not apply. Any disputes relating to these Terms, the Services, or the Materials not subject to arbitration will be heard in the courts located in Union County, Arkansas. If any of these Terms are deemed inconsistent with applicable law, then those terms will be interpreted to reflect the intentions of the parties, and no other terms will be modified. By choosing not to enforce any of these Terms, we are not waiving our rights. These Terms are the entire agreement between you and us and they supersede all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions, or agreements between you and Murphy USA about everything covered by these Terms, including the Services and the Materials.</p>
<p>The proprietary rights, disclaimer of warranties, representations made by you, indemnities, limitations of liability, and general provisions will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>

<p><strong>MODIFICATION &amp; TERMINATION OF </strong><strong>MURPHY DRIVE REWARDS PROGRAM &amp; BENEFITS</strong></p>
<p>Murphy USA may change the Murphy Drive Rewards program, associated rewards points or other rewards, and these Program Terms and Conditions at any time, for any reason and without notice to you. Murphy USA may make changes that affect, without limitation, processes, benefits, levels, rules for accumulated and redeeming rewards points, rewards point redemption levels, rules for the use of rewards points, availability of rewards points, reward types, availability of Offers, and benefits of the Murphy Drive Rewards program and Member benefits.</p>

At Murphy USA’s sole discretion, Murphy USA may choose to substitute a similar loyalty program for the Murphy Drive Rewards program at any time immediately upon notice to active Members.

Murphy USA may terminate the Murphy Drive Rewards program in whole or in part, in any jurisdiction, on less than one month's notice if required to do so by applicable law, as determined by Murphy USA in its reasonable discretion.</p>
<p>All Murphy Drive Rewards program benefits, offers, rewards, and services are subject to availability and may be changed at any time without notice. By accepting Murphy Drive Rewards program benefits, offers, rewards, and services, including rewards points, each Member acknowledges that he or she is responsible for determining whether he or she is eligible to receive the benefits, offers, rewards, or services (including rewards points) under applicable laws, gift policies, and incentive policies. At any time and in Murphy USA’s sole discretion (including where a Member was not eligible to accumulate certain rewards points according to these Program Terms and Conditions), Murphy USA may correct the amount of rewards points shown as credited to a Member’s account.</p>
<p><strong>MISCELLANEOUS </strong></p>
<p>Murphy USA’s interpretation or application of these Program Terms and Conditions will be binding on all Members. By joining the Murphy Drive Rewards program, you agree to be bound by these Program Terms and Conditions.

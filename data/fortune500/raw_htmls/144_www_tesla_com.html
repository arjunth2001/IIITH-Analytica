                                                            <li>Through our Digital Services: We may collect information from or about you through our websites, software applications, social media pages, e-mail messages, or other digital services (the “Digital Services”), e.g., when you sign up for a newsletter, make a purchase, or register your product with us.</li>
                                <li>Through credit applications and other forms: We may collect additional information from you or others on your behalf on our credit application and other forms to support our product lease or other financing offerings, such as date of birth, Social Security number, bank routing information, and credit related information. We also receive information about you from consumer reporting agencies such as credit history and capacity.</li>
                                <li>From other sources: We also may receive information about you from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, certified installers, third-party vehicle repair or service centers, and social media platforms.</li>
                                                        <li>Tesla Account: Customers who purchase certain Tesla products will receive a Tesla Account, which is hosted on our website.

You can access your Tesla Account to update the information from or about you in that account at any time.</li>
                            <li>Offline: We may collect information from or about you offline, such as when you visit a Tesla store or repair facility, attend one of our events, sign up for a test drive, place an order over the phone, or contact our customer service or sales department.</li>
                            <li>Through your browser or device: Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version, and the name and version of the Digital Services (such as the Tesla App) you are using.

                        <p>We may collect a variety of information from or about your Tesla vehicle, including:</p>

                        <ul>
                                                            <li>Telematics log data: To improve our vehicles and services for you, we may collect certain telematics data regarding the performance, usage, operation, and condition of your Tesla vehicle, including: vehicle identification number; speed information; odometer readings; battery use management information; battery charging history; electrical system functions; software version information; infotainment system data; safety-related data and camera images (including information regarding the vehicle’s SRS systems, braking and acceleration, security, e-brake, and accidents); short video clips of accidents; information regarding the use and operation of Autopilot, Summon, and other features; and other data to assist in identifying issues and analyzing the performance of the vehicle. We may collect such information either in person (such as during a service appointment) or via remote access.</li>
                                                        <li>Remote analysis data: We may be able to dynamically connect to your Tesla vehicle to diagnose and resolve issues with it, and this process may result in access to personal settings in the vehicle (such as contacts, browsing history, navigation history, and radio listening history). This dynamic connection also enables us to view the current location of your vehicle, but such access is restricted to a limited number of personnel within Tesla.</li>
                            <li>Other vehicle data: In order to help improve our products and services, we may collect and store other vehicle data, including: data about accidents involving your Tesla vehicle (e.g., air bag deployment and other recent sensor data); data about remote services (e.g., remote lock/unlock, start/stop charge, and honk-the-horn commands); a data report to confirm that your vehicle is online together with information about the current software version and certain telematics data; vehicle connectivity information; data about any issues that could materially impair operation of your vehicle; data about any safety-critical issues; and data about each software and firmware update. We may collect such information either in person (such as during a service appointment) or via remote access.</li>
                            <li>Service history: In order to facilitate the servicing of your car, we may collect and process data about the service history of each Tesla vehicle, such as the customer’s name, vehicle identification number, repair history, any outstanding recalls, any bills due, any customer complaints, and any other information related to its service history.</li>
                                                            <li>Charging station information: We may collect information regarding the charge rate and charging stations used by you (including outlets) in order to, e.g., analyze which charging stations are being utilized, how long and efficient battery charges are, and where additional charging stations are needed.</li>
                                                        <li>Advanced features:</li>

We also may collect similar data in connection with other features, such as the navigation data for the online routing feature, and may share it with business partners where necessary to provide the feature to you, but, again, we only collect or share the data in a way that does not identify you or your car. We also only collect or share this data if you enable this collection, although if you do so, your vehicle may send this data to Tesla and its partners even if you are not actively using a feature that needs this information. You can enable or disable the collection and sharing of this data at any time via the “DATA SHARING” setting in Controls &gt; Settings &gt; Safety &amp; Security.</li>
                                                                <li>To further help develop and improve autonomous safety features, we may collect short video clips using the car’s external cameras to learn how to recognize things like lane lines, street signs, and traffic light positions. These short video clips are not linked to your vehicle identification number and we have ensured that there is no way to search our system for clips that are associated with a specific car. You can enable or disable the collection of these clips any time via the “DATA SHARING” setting in Controls &gt; Settings &gt; Safety &amp; Security.</li>
                            </ul>

Please note that if you opt out from the collection of telematics log data or any other data from your Tesla vehicle (with the exception of the Data Sharing setting detailed above), we will not be able to notify you of issues applicable to your vehicle in real time. This may result in your vehicle suffering from reduced functionality, serious damage, or inoperability, and it may also disable many features of your vehicle including periodic software and firmware updates, remote services, and interactivity with mobile applications and in-car features such as location search, Internet radio, voice commands, and web browser functionality.</p>

These legitimate interests may include Tesla’s interest in improving its products and services, enhancing safety and security, protecting Tesla or its business partners against wrongful conduct, and responding to customer inquiries and claims. Where applicable, we will inform you whether and why we need certain information from you, for example, whether we need the information to fulfill a legal or contractual requirement and what the consequences are of not providing the information.</p>

                            <p>Tesla, Inc. and its wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries (collectively, “Tesla U.S.”) have subscribed to and will comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (the “Frameworks”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the processing of Personal Information (as defined below) that is transferred from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. Tesla U.S. has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles (the “Principles”). If there is any conflict between this Policy and the Principles, the Principles will govern.  To learn more about the Frameworks, and to view our certification, please visit <a href="http://www.privacyshield.gov" target="_blank">www.privacyshield.gov</a>.</p>

                            <p>This Privacy Shield Policy supplements our <a href="#privacy-policy">Customer Privacy Policy</a>. Capitalized terms used in this Privacy Shield Policy have the meaning given to them by our <a href="#privacy-policy">Customer Privacy Policy</a>, unless specifically defined in this Policy. This Privacy Shield Policy applies to Tesla U.S., which is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.</p>

                            <p><b>Personal Information Received from the European Economic Area and Switzerland</b></p>

                            <p>Tesla U.S. may receive from the EEA and Switzerland some or all of the information listed in our <a href="#privacy-policy">Customer Privacy Policy</a>. Some of that information may qualify as “personal information” or “personal data” (collectively, “Personal Information”) as defined in the Principles. To the extent that Tesla U.S. receives Personal Information from the EEA and Switzerland in reliance on the Frameworks, Tesla U.S. will handle such Personal Information in accordance with the Principles.</p>

                            <p><b>Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation</b></p>
                            <p>Tesla U.S. may use the Personal Information it receives from the EEA and Switzerland for the purposes set forth in our <a href="#privacy-policy">Customer Privacy Policy</a> or as you may otherwise be notified. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Information we process is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current to the extent necessary for the purposes for which we use the Personal Information. We will not process Personal Information in a way that is incompatible with the purposes for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by you. We will adhere to the Principles for as long as we retain the Personal Information collected under the Frameworks.</p>

                            <p><b>Onward Transfers</b></p>
                            <p>Our <a href="#privacy-policy">Customer Privacy Policy</a> describes the circumstances in which we may disclose your information to third parties. We remain responsible for the processing of Personal Information received under the Frameworks and subsequently transferred to a third party acting as an agent if the agent processes such Personal Information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
                            <p>We may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>

                            <p>We use reasonable and appropriate measures to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Information.</p>

                            <p><b>Choice</b></p>
                            <p>We will give you an opportunity to choose whether your Personal Information may be used for a purpose that is materially different from the purposes for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you, or if we intend to disclose it to a third party acting as a data controller that we have not previously disclosed to you. In such circumstances, we will notify you and offer you the opportunity to opt out of such uses and/or disclosures where non-sensitive Personal Information is involved, and to opt in where sensitive Personal Information is involved.</p>

                            <p><b>Access to Personal Information</b></p>
                            <p>Our <a href="#privacy-policy">Customer Privacy Policy</a> sets forth methods by which you may access and/or submit requests to review, correct, update, suppress, or delete information from or about you.

                        <h2>Patent Pledge</h2>

                        <p>On June 12, 2014, <a href="/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you">Tesla announced</a> that it will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use its technology. Tesla was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport, and this policy is intended to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting Tesla, other companies making electric vehicles, and the world.  These guidelines provide further detail as to how we are implementing this policy.  </p>
                        <p><b>Tesla’s Pledge</b></p>
                        <p>Tesla irrevocably pledges that it will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing a Tesla Patent through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith.  Key terms of the Pledge are explained below.</p>
                        <p><b>Definition of Key Terms</b></p>
                        <p>"Tesla Patents" means all patents owned now or in the future by Tesla (other than a patent owned jointly with a third party or any patent that Tesla later acquires that comes with an encumbrance that prevents it from being subject to this Pledge).  A list of Tesla Patents subject to the Pledge will be maintained at the following URL: <a href="/about/legal#patent-list">https://www.tesla.com/about/legal#patent-list</a>.</p>
                        <p>A party is "acting in good faith" for so long as such party and its related or affiliated companies have not:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>asserted, helped others assert or had a financial stake in any assertion of (i) any patent or other intellectual property right against Tesla or (ii) any patent right against a third party for its use of technologies relating to electric vehicles or related equipment;  </li>
                            <li>challenged, helped others challenge, or had a financial stake in any challenge to any Tesla patent; or</li>
                            <li>marketed or sold any knock-off product (e.g., a product created by imitating or copying the design or appearance of a Tesla product or which suggests an association with or endorsement by Tesla) or provided any material assistance to another party doing so. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><b>Transfer of Tesla Patents</b></p>
                        <p>Should Tesla ever transfer a Tesla Patent to a third party, it will do so only to a party that agrees, by means of a public declaration intended to be binding on such party, to provide the same protection that Tesla provided under the Pledge and to place the same requirement on any subsequent transferee.</p>
                        <p><b>Legal Effect</b></p>
                        <p>The Pledge, which is irrevocable and legally binding on Tesla and its successors, is a "standstill," meaning that it is a forbearance of enforcement of Tesla’s remedies against any party for claims of infringement for so long as such party is acting in good faith.  In order for Tesla to preserve its ability to enforce the Tesla Patents against any party not acting in good faith, the Pledge is not a waiver of any patent claims (including claims for damages for past acts of infringement) and is not a license, covenant not to sue, or authorization to engage in patented activities or a limitation on remedies, damages or claims.  Except as expressly stated in the Pledge, no rights shall be deemed granted, waived or received by implication, exhaustion, estoppel or otherwise.  Finally, the Pledge is not an indication of the value of an arms-length, negotiated license or a reasonable royalty.</p>
                        <p>What this pledge means is that as long as someone uses our patents for electric vehicles and doesn’t do bad things, such as knocking off our products or using our patents and then suing us for intellectual property infringement, they should have no fear of Tesla asserting its patents against them.</p>

                        <p><b>Idle Fee</b></p>

                        <p>In consideration of others who need to use a Supercharger, we ask that you move your vehicle when it is finished charging. To encourage this, you will incur an idle fee for the time your car remains parked in a charging stall after it is finished charging. We will waive the idle fee if your car is moved within five minutes after it is finished charging, and the idle fee will not accumulate while less than half of the charging stalls at your location are occupied. All vehicles are subject to idle fees, regardless of when your vehicle was purchased. To avoid idle fees, we recommend you monitor your vehicle while using a Supercharger and encourage you to use the Tesla mobile app to track your vehicle's charge status.</p>

                        <p>Idle fees are incurred on a per minute basis. The idle fee rate for each location may change from time to time, and the latest information is provided in the map pin pop-up (accessible through the navigation application on your vehicle touchscreen). By remaining parked in a charging stall after your vehicle is finished charging, you accept the idle fee rate communicated to you through the map pin pop-up. For additional information, please see our idle fee <a href="/support/supercharger-idle-fee">support page</a> and address other inquiries to

                        <p><b>Pay Per Use</b></p>

                        <p>All vehicles ordered after January 15, 2017, and vehicles ordered by January 15, 2017 but built after April 15, 2017, are enabled for Supercharging on a pay per use basis. Any credits for free Supercharging that are given with the purchase of a vehicle, including any annual renewal of credits, expire upon the sale or transfer of the vehicle and are not transferable to any subsequent vehicle owner, or to any other vehicle. Credits for Supercharging expire after a set period of time and do not rollover into future periods.</p>

                        <p>Pay per use billing is on a per kilowatt hour basis in jurisdictions where this is feasible, and as a service fee on a per minute basis in other jurisdictions. The pay per use billing unit and rate for each location may change from time to time, and the latest information is provided in the map pin pop-up (accessible through the navigation application on your vehicle touchscreen). By charging your vehicle in a particular location, you accept the price of charging communicated to you through the map pin pop-up.

                        <h2>Supercharger Fair Use Policy</h2>

                        <p><b>Introduction</b></p>

                        <p>We are continually expanding our global network of Supercharger stations to enable personal long distance travel and to provide a charging solution for those without immediate access to home or workplace charging, thereby accelerating the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. When Superchargers are used beyond their intended purpose, it negatively impacts the availability of Supercharging services for others.</p>

                        <p><b>Supercharger Fair Use</b></p>

                        <p>To help ensure that Superchargers are available for their intended use, we ask that you not charge your vehicle using a Supercharger if your vehicle is being used:

                        </p><ul>
                            <li>as a taxi;</li>
                            <li>for ridesourcing or ridesharing (through Uber, Lyft or similar services);</li>
                            <li>to commercially deliver or transport goods;</li>
                            <li>for government purposes; or</li>
                            <li>for any other commercial venture.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>If you charge your vehicle in a manner that does not comply with this Supercharger Fair Use Policy, we may ask you to modify this behavior. We may also take additional action to protect the availability of Superchargers for their intended purpose, such as limiting or blocking your vehicle’s ability to use Supercharger stations.</p>

                        <p>This Policy applies to all Superchargers worldwide and all Tesla vehicles purchased, either new or used, whether from Tesla or a third party, after December 15, 2017. Tesla may choose to exclude certain Supercharger stations or occasional trips from the scope of this Policy, such as to accommodate specific local circumstances.</p>

                        <p><b>Charging Alternatives</b></p>

                        <p>We encourage the commercial use of Tesla vehicles while using appropriate charging solutions. Please reach out to your local sales contact to explore vehicle and charging options that suit your needs. For questions related to home charging, please contact <a href="mailto:charginginstallation@tesla.com">charginginstallation@tesla.com</a>.</p>

                        <p>An unsupported or salvaged vehicle is a vehicle that has been declared a total loss, commonly after extensive damage caused by a crash, flooding, fire, or similar hazard, and has been (or qualifies to be) registered and/or titled by its owner as a salvaged vehicle or its equivalent pursuant to local jurisdiction or industry practice. Salvage registration/titling typically can never be removed from the vehicle so that all future persons understand the condition and value of the vehicle. Tesla does not warrant the safety or operability of salvaged vehicles. Repairs performed to bring a salvaged vehicle back into service may not meet Tesla standards or specifications and that is why the vehicle is unsupported.  Consequently, any failures, damages, or injuries occurring as a result of such repairs or continued operation of an unsupported vehicle are solely the responsibility of the vehicle owner.</p>

                        <h2>Human Rights And Conflict Minerals Policy</h2>

                        <p>Tesla expects our suppliers to conduct their worldwide operations in responsible manner in adherence of this policy and the principles enumerated herein. Tesla works collaboratively with our suppliers to encourage compliance with the following principles:</p>

                        <p><b>Legal And Regulatory Compliance</b></p>
                        <p>Tesla suppliers are to ensure their operations and the products and services supplied to Tesla comply with all national and other applicable laws and regulations.</p>

                        <p><b>Conflict Minerals</b></p>
                        <p>Tesla's suppliers are expected to use reasonable efforts to ensure that parts and products supplied to Tesla are DRC "conflict-free," meaning that such conflict minerals do not benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Conflict-free means such parts and supplies do not contain metals derived from "conflict minerals" which are defined as:</p>

                        <br>

                        <p>The goal of this policy is to ensure that Tesla's products do not directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups through mining or mineral trading in the DRC and adjoining countries. Tesla requires its suppliers to establish policies, due diligence frameworks, and management systems, consistent with the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/mne/GuidanceEdition2.pdf" target="_blank">OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas</a>, that are designed to accomplish this goal. Tesla expects its suppliers to stay up-to-date with and to use validated conflict free smelters and refiners assessed by the <a href="http://www.responsiblemineralsinitiative.org/" target="_blank">Responsible Mineral Initiative</a> and similar organizations. Tesla performs ongoing due diligence and files annual reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.</p>

                        <p><b>Human Rights</b></p>

                                                    <p>Tesla is committed to ensuring that its suppliers do not use slave or child labor or engage in human trafficking. Tesla does not, and will not, tolerate the use of slave or child labor in the manufacture of its products and does not, and will not, accept products or services from suppliers that engage in human trafficking in any form. Human trafficking, child labor and slavery are crimes under state, federal and international law. These crimes exist in countries throughout the world.</p>

                            <p><b>Supplier Compliance</b></p>
                            <p>Tesla will do the following to ensure compliance by its suppliers with this policy as required by law and as needed:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Evaluate its supply chain to address risks related to conflict minerals, human trafficking, slavery and child labor;</li>
                                <li>Audit suppliers, to evaluate supplier compliance with Tesla's Human Rights and Conflict Minerals Policy;</li>
                                <li>Require direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into Tesla products comply with the laws regarding conflict minerals, slavery, child labor and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business;</li>
                                <li>Discipline employees or contractors, including potential termination of contract, who fail to meet Tesla's Human Rights and Conflict Minerals Policy;</li>
                                <li>Train certain Tesla employees regarding conflict minerals, human trafficking, child labor and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the Tesla's supply chain;</li>
                                <li>Investigate if Tesla has a reasonable basis to believe that a Tesla supplier is engaging in human trafficking, slave or child labor, or use of conflict minerals; and</li>
                                <li>Transition away from purchasing goods or services from any supplier that is believed to be engaging in human trafficking, slave or child labor, or use of conflict minerals if the supplier does not take corrective actions within a reasonable period of time.</li>
                            </ul>

	<p>Although the above chart describes examples of information we collect and our primary purpose in collecting such information, in many situations we have more than one legitimate purpose. For example, if you complete an online order we collect your payment and shipping information to perform our contract with you (e.g., to process and fulfill your order), but we also collect your information because we have a legitimate interest in maintaining your information after your transaction is complete so that we can quickly and easily respond to any questions about your order. As a result, our collection and processing of your information is based in different contexts upon: (i) your consent (e.g., to place cookies or for marketing), (ii) the performance of our contract with you (e.g., to provide you with products and services you have requested); (iii) compliance with legal obligations (e.g., where we are required to disclose information to a court or tax authority); and/or (iv) our legitimate interests in conducting our business.</p>

	<p>To the extent that any Information is considered “personal information” by local law, we treat this information as such and ensure that our handling of this information complies with all applicable data privacy and protection laws. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any Information you provide to us directly may be combined with other Information that you provide to us through other channels, that is publicly available, or that we may otherwise obtain, including from third parties.</p>

	<ol type="A"><li><u>Social Networks/Online Communities</u>

		<p>On certain Sites, we may enable you to access online communities for sharing information such as messages, photos, and videos. We may also enable you to post content from some Sites to your profile on other social networks. We cannot control any policies or terms of such third party social networks. For example, sharing such information with Facebook may require us to implement cookies and/or APIs in order to facilitate the communication between our Sites and Facebook. That information, shared through cookies and/or APIs, then becomes subject to Facebook’s Data Policy, located at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/full_data_use_policy" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/full_data_use_policy</a>. As a result, we cannot be responsible for any use of your information or content by a third party social network, which you use at your own risk.</p>
		</li>
		<li><u>Linked Sites</u>
		<p>Our Sites may contain links to third-party websites or applications not controlled by Molson Coors or covered by this Privacy Policy. If you submit information to any of those websites or applications, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website or application that you visit.&nbsp; We have no control or authority over third-party sites and are not responsible for any information that you may submit on that site.</p>
		</li>
		<li><u>Transactions</u>
		<p>In some cases, we may use a third-party payment service to process purchases made through the Sites, including but not limited to reservation booking sites, consumer promotions sites, and eCommerce/online retail shop sites.&nbsp; In these cases, your information may be collected by this third party and not by us, and will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; We have no control over, and are not responsible for, this third party’s use or disclosure of your information.</p>
		</li>
		<li><u>Widgets and Interactive Applications</u>
		<p>Our Sites may include interactive programs that provide specific services from another company, such as “liking” or sharing content, often referred to as widgets. You may have the opportunity to submit Information, such as your email or phone number for collection through a widget. A widget may also use cookies and/or collect usage data. Information collected by a widget is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.</p>

	<p>If you have any questions or comments regarding this Privacy Policy, or if you would like to review, update, correct, or remove any Information from our records, please contact us using the information below. Once we receive your request for removal, we will remove your Information from our records unless we have a specific legal requirement/legitimate interest to retain your Information. However, except where disclosure is required by law, we may decide not to grant access or make revisions where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in any given case, or when the rights of others would be violated by granting the access. Any requested deletions or changes may not be effective immediately. We will aim to address your request as soon as practicable.</p>

	<p>Our Sites may include interactive programs that provide specific services from another company, such as “liking” or sharing content, often referred to as widgets. You may have the opportunity to submit Information, such as your email address, for collection through a widget. A widget may also use cookies and/or collect usage data. Information collected by a widget is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.</p>

	<ol type="A"><li><u>Legal Basis for Processing.</u> All processing (i.e., collection and use) of your Information is based on one of a number of legal conditions. Generally, these include:

		<ul style="list-style-type:disc"><li>Your consent (for example, to place cookies which process Information, or to receive marketing communications from us);</li>
			<li>The performance of our contract with you (e.g., to process your payment or shipping information in order to fulfil your order);</li>
			<li>Compliance with a legal obligation (e.g., where we are required to disclose information to a court or a tax authority); and</li>
			<li>Our legitimate interests, provided these do not override your fundamental rights and freedoms (e.g., where we carry out research and analysis to improve our Site, products and services).</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li><u>Rights of EU Residents.</u> Subject to applicable law, as a resident of the EU, you may have certain rights with respect to your Information. These rights may include some of the following:
		<ul style="list-style-type:disc"><li>To obtain a copy of your Information together with information about how and on what basis that Information is processed;</li>
			<li>To rectify inaccurate Information (including the right to have incomplete Information completed);</li>
			<li>To erase your Information (in limited circumstances, where it is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or processed);</li>
			<li>To restrict processing of your Information where:
			<ul style="list-style-type:circle"><li>The accuracy of the Information is contested;</li>
				<li>The processing is unlawful but you object to the erasure of the Information;</li>
				<li>We no longer require the Information but it is still required for the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal claim;</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>To challenge processing which we have justified based on a legitimate interest (as opposed to your consent, or to perform a contract with you);</li>
			<li>To prevent us from sending you direct marketing;</li>
			<li>To withdraw your consent to our processing of your Information (where that processing is based on your consent);</li>
			<li>To object to decisions which are based solely on automated processing or profiling; and</li>
			<li>To obtain, or see a copy of the appropriate safeguards under which your Information is transferred to a third country or international organization.</li>
		</ul><p>In addition to the above, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority (for example, the ICO in the United Kingdom).</p>

		<p>Please contact us using the details above to exercise your rights. As noted above, we will request proof of identity, and verify such identity. Additionally, we reserve the right to charge a fee where permitted by law, including for example, if your request is manifestly excessive or unfounded. Lastly, we will respond to your requests within the applicable timeframes and consistent with applicable regulations.</p>
		</li>
		<li><u>International Transfers for EU Residents</u>
		<p>You should be aware that Molson Coors is headquartered in the United States with corporate offices abroad. Your Information may be transferred to and stored in the United States for processing. By submitting your Information to us you agree to the transfer, storage and processing of your information in a country other than your country of residence including, but not necessarily limited to, the United States.</p>

		<p>Additionally, any information that you provide to or that is collected by or on behalf of Molson Coors may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world consistent with the practices described within this Privacy Policy. The privacy laws in these countries may be less stringent than the laws in your country of residence. Molson Coors take steps to protect your Information using the same privacy principles and securities that apply pursuant to the law of the country in which you reside.</p>

		<p>In relation to both internal transfers and the use of affiliates, service providers or suppliers, for information that is transferred outside the European Economic Area ("<strong>EEA</strong>"), we enter into data transfer agreements, use the EU Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses, or rely on certification schemes such as the EU - US Privacy Shield. You may have a right to request additional details about the mechanisms under which your data is transferred outside the EEA. If you would like more information concerning our attempts to apply the privacy principles applicable in one jurisdiction to data when it goes to another jurisdiction you can contact us using the contact information above.</p>

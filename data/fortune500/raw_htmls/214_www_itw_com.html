		<p><strong>Illinois Tool Works, Inc.</strong> (“<strong>ITW</strong>“, “<strong>we</strong>“, “<strong>us</strong>“, or “<strong>our</strong>“) respects your personal privacy and is committed to adhering to the applicable privacy and data protection laws and industry guidelines. This privacy statement (“<strong>Privacy Statement</strong>“) describes how we handle the information we collect about you on the <a href="https://www.itw.com">www.ITW.com</a> website (the “<strong>Website</strong>“) and the choices and rights available to you with respect to such information. </p>
<p>This Privacy Statement applies only to this ITW Website and to ITW’s handling of information collected through this Website. This Privacy Statement does <em>not</em> apply to any third-party sites that may be accessible from here (including any ITW affiliate or business unit sites) or to the processing of personal information by such third-parties.</p>
<p>This Website is operated by ITW in the United States and any personal information submitted through the Website will result in the collection and processing of such information in the United States. As a result, if you are visiting the Website from a country other than the United States, your personal information will cross an international boundary. The level of protection for your personal information in the United States may not be the same as the level of protection in your country.</p>
<p>After reading this Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into and is a part of this Website’s <a title="Terms &amp; Conditions of Use" href="https://itw.com/utilities/terms-conditions/">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>, you will know:</p>

<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Statement, our use of your personal information collected through this Website, or your rights with respect to such use, you may contact us using the contact details provided under the <a href="#section8">How You Can Contact ITW</a> section below.</p>
<h5 id="section1"> 1. INFORMATION ITW COLLECTS FROM YOU AND HOW WE USE IT</h5>
<h4>COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
<p>We collect information on this Website that can be used to identify or contact a particular person (we refer to this type of information as “<strong>personal information</strong>“). Personal information includes information that does not directly identify you by name or include your contact information, but which may be used to identify that a specific computer or device has accessed our Website and which if combined with certain other information could be used to identify you. The types of personal information we collect and process include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full name</li>
<li>Contact information (work or home postal address; work, mobile or home telephone number; work or home fax number; work or personal email address)</li>
<li>Employer and job title</li>
<li>Education and experience information (CV information; professional experience; education; certifications; personal interests)</li>
<li>Internet Protocol (IP) address</li>
<li><a href="#log-data">Log data</a> (described <a href="#log-data">below</a>)</li>
<li><a href="#location-data">Location data</a> (described <a href="#location-data">below</a>)</li>
<li><a href="#cookie-data">Cookie data</a> (described <a href="#cookie-data">below</a>)</li>
<li>Social media use and utilization</li>
</ul>
<p>We actively collect personal information from our Website visitors when they provide it to us directly in responding to specific questions or requests on the Website (e.g., personal information provided through our Website submission form or careers page). ITW uses this information for the purposes of pursuing its ordinary course of business as described in more detail below. For example, if you submit an inquiry to us through our Website submission form, your personal information will be used to track and respond to your inquiry and provide you with the information and support requested. Similarly, if you provide your resume to ITW for purposes of obtaining employment, the resume will be used for activities related to your potential employment. The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information on the Website.</p>
<p>From time to time, we may also use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about changes to our terms, conditions, and policies (such as changes to this Privacy Statement when required under applicable law). Because this information is important to your interaction with ITW, you may not opt-out of receiving such communications.</p>
<p>To the extent non-personal information (e.g., <a href="#log-data">log data</a>, <a href="#location-data">location data</a>, or <a href="#cookie-data">cookie data</a>) is combined with personal information, we treat such combined information as personal information for purposes of this Privacy Statement. We use this combined information for the purposes described in the <a href="#non-personal-info">Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</a> section below, our <a href="#section2">Cookie Notice</a>, and as otherwise described in this Privacy Statement.</p>
<h4>COMPATIBILITY</h4>
<p>In general and as required under applicable law, we will use the personal information we collect from you only for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement or for purposes that we explain to you at the time we collect your personal information. However, we may also use your personal information for other purposes that are not incompatible with the purposes we have disclosed to you (such as archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes) if and where this is permitted by applicable data protection laws. In any event, we take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and, where necessary, kept up-to-date.</p>
<div>
<h3 class="orange-title noborder">LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION (EUROPEAN VISITORS ONLY)</h3>
</div>
<p>If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, the legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Statement will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, the applicable legal basis for our processing of your personal information normally includes one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Based on your consent. </strong> In some cases, at the point at which you provide personal information, we may ask you for your consent to collect and process such information. If you choose to provide us with your consent, you may later withdraw your consent (or opt-out) by contacting us using the contact details provided under the <a href="#section8">How You Can Contact ITW</a> section below. Please note that if you withdraw your consent it will not affect any processing of your personal information that has already occurred. Where we process your personal information based on consent, we will provide more detailed information to you at the time when we obtain your consent.
</li>
<li><strong>Performance of a contract.</strong>  In specific circumstances, we may need to process your personal information to fulfill our obligations under a contract to which you are subject. Where we are processing your personal information to fulfill our obligations under a contract to which you are a party, you may not be able to object to such processing, or if you do choose to opt-out or object to such processing, it may impact our ability to perform a contractual obligation that you are owed.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with applicable laws. </strong> In specific circumstances, we may need to process your personal information to comply with an applicable law. Where we process your personal information to meet our legal obligations, you will likely not be permitted to object to such processing, but you will usually have the right to access or review the relevant personal information unless it would impede our legal obligations.</li>
<li><strong>ITW’s legitimate interests.</strong>  We may process your personal information based on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party) to the extent such interests are not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In such cases, you have the right to object to the relevant processing of your personal information by contacting us as described under the <a href="#section8">How You Can Contact ITW</a> section below.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li id="log-data"><strong>Log data.</strong>  When you use or interact with our Website, our servers record certain information that is automatically reported by your browser (such as Apple’s Safari, Microsoft’s Edge, Google’s Chrome, or Mozilla’s Firefox) or device each time you request our Website, or when content is downloaded to your browser or device from our Website. This “<strong>log data</strong>” includes your IP address (which is used to infer approximate location); Internet service provider; browser type and settings (e.g., content language, cookie/DNT preferences); device information (e.g., type of device, operating system, device manufacturer); referring/exiting URL; request/response date and time; clickstream data; device ID or advertising ID; and data contained in first-party cookies and similar technologies (discussed further below and in our <a href="#section2">Cookie Notice</a>). Some of the information we collect depends on the settings on your web browser. Please check your web browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings. <em>To the extent that IP addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information under applicable law, we also treat such identifiers as personal information.</em></li>
<li id="location-data"><strong>Location data.</strong>  Depending on your computer or device permissions, we may collect information about your device’s approximate (e.g., country or zip code) or precise location (“<strong>location data</strong>“). Various technologies may be used to collect this location information, such as IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may provide information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points, and cell towers. <em>We will only collect your computer’s or device’s precise location with your consent.</em></li>
<li id="cookie-data"><strong>Cookie data.</strong>  Our Website uses cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies (referred to as “<strong>cookies and similar technologies</strong>“) to collect and store certain non-personal information (such as <a href="#log-data">log data</a> and <a href="#location-data">location data</a>) when you visit or interact with our Website to help us secure our Website, as well as the information processed through our Website; monitor and enhance the performance of our Website; better understand Website visitor behavior; and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and Website features (information contained in or generated by the use of cookies and similar technologies is referred to in this Privacy Statement as “<strong>cookie data</strong>“). We treat information collected through the use of cookies and similar technologies as non personal information. These cookies and similar technologies, including their use on our Website and your choices regarding such use, are further described in our <a href="#section2">Cookie Notice</a> below.</li>
</ul>
<p>We passively collect the information described above to understand what areas of this Website are most popular, which areas may require improvement, and what technologies are being used by our visitors. This information helps us to better understand visitor behavior and to update and improve this Website and our advertising. We also use this information for security purposes, to detect and to block security breaches, and to provide you with a safe online environment.

<p>In addition, when we aggregate or anonymize information (including personal information), such aggregated or anonymized data is considered non personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Statement and may be used and shared by us for any legitimate business purpose.</p>
<p>If we combine non-personal information with personal information, such combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.</p>

However, if we associate non-personal information (such as <a href="#cookie-data">cookie data</a>) with personal information, the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.</li>
<li><strong>Pixel Tags.</strong>  Pixel tags (also known as web beacons) are small blocks of code installed on our Website which enable our online partners to serve cookies when you visit our Website and are generally used in combination with cookies to track visitor activity on our Website, receive relevant <a href="#log-data">log data</a>, <a href="#location-data">location data</a> and <a href="#cookie-data">cookie data</a>, and perform other activities relating to the monitoring and analysis of the use and performance of our Website.</li>

<h4>SOCIAL MEDIA PLUGINS</h4>
<p>Our Website may use Social Media Plugins to enable you to easily share information with others. When you visit our Website, the operator of the social media plugin that is on our Website can place a cookie on your computer that lets such operator recognize individuals on their website who have previously visited our Website. If you have previously logged into the social media website while browsing on our Website, social media plugins may allow that social media website to receive directly identifiable information about you that shows you have visited our Website. The social media plugin may collect this information for visitors who have logged into social networks, whether or not they specifically interact with the plugin on our Website. Social media plugins also allow the social media website to share information about your activities on our Website with other users of their social media website. ITW does not control any of the content from social media plugins. For more information about social plugins from social media websites, you should refer to those sites’ privacy and data sharing statements.</p>

This is referred to as a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) signal. Please note that currently our Website does not respond to these signals from web browsers. At this time, there is no universally accepted standard for what a company should do when a DNT signal is detected.</p>

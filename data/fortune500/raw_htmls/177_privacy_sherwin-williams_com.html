<h3 align="left"><u>CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</u></h3>

<p>Under the CCPA, California Consumers have certain rights they may exercise either independently or through an authorized agent.&nbsp; CCPA rights requests are subject to an identification and verification process.&nbsp; We will not fulfill a CCPA request unless we have been provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify that the requestor is the Consumer about whom we collected PI.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some PI we maintain about Consumers (e.g., clickstream data) is not sufficiently associated with enough PI about the Consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular Consumer’s PI.&nbsp; Accordingly, we will not include such information in response to Consumer requests.&nbsp; If we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response.&nbsp; You are not required to create an account with us to make a request. We will use PI provided in your request only to verify your identity or authority to make the request and to track and document request responses, unless you also provided the PI to us for another purpose.</p>

<p>We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer PI that we collect, use, store, disclose, or otherwise process, and to respond to your California Consumer privacy rights requests.&nbsp; In some cases, particularly with voluminous or typically irrelevant data, we may provide you with a summary of your PI and give you the opportunity to elect whether you want us to provide the entire data set.&nbsp; Or we may direct you on how to access and copy responsive PI yourself.&nbsp; We may charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act upon a request if the request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome.&nbsp; If we determine that the request warrants a fee, or that we may decline to comply with the request, we will give you notice explaining why we made that decision.&nbsp; In the case of a fee, we will provide a cost estimate and the opportunity to accept such fees before charging you for responding to your request.</p>

<p><strong><u>California Residents – Your Rights and Contacting Us</u></strong></p>

<p>Your California Consumer privacy rights are described below.&nbsp; To make a request, you can submit a case through our on-line <a href="https://sherwinwilliams.ethicspointvp.com/custom/sherwinwilliams/web/en/dp/form_data.asp?SourceName=test&amp;SourceURL=">Global Privacy Portal</a> or by calling 1-<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"><meta http-equiv="Content-Style-Type" content="text/css"> <meta name="Generator" content="Cocoa HTML Writer"><meta name="CocoaVersion" content="1671.6">

span.s1 {font-kerning: none}
</style>
<strong>(844) 835-4135</strong> . Please follow the instructions on our <a href="https://sherwinwilliams.ethicspointvp.com/custom/sherwinwilliams/web/en/dp/form_data.asp?SourceName=test&amp;SourceURL=">Global Privacy Portal</a> and promptly respond to any follow-up inquires so that we may confirm your identity.&nbsp; If you request that we provide you with specific pieces of information about you, we will apply heightened verification standards.&nbsp; Authorized Agents may submit requests on behalf of Consumers by following these steps and providing appropriate documentation.</p>

<p><strong><u>Disclosure Rights</u></strong></p>

<p>You have the right to request that we disclose the following information for the 12-month period prior to the request date.&nbsp; Consumer requests of this nature may be made no more than twice in a 12-month period.&nbsp; With respect to (1) and (2) below, we will provide this information in a portable and, if technically feasible, readily usable format.</p>

<ol>
	<li>The categories of PI we have collected about you.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
		<li>The categories of sources from which we collected your PI.</li>
		<li>The business or commercial purpose(s) for our collection of your PI.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The specific pieces of PI we have collected about you.</li>
	<li>The categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed your PI.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
		<li>A list of the categories of PI disclosed for a business purpose in the prior 12 months (or a statement that no such disclosure occurred).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A list of the categories of PI sold about you in the prior 12 months, including the categories of third parties to whom we sold your PI and the business or commercial purposes for the sale (or a statement that no such sale occurred).&nbsp; <a name="_Hlk12887470"></a></li>
</ol>

<p><strong><u>Verification for Disclosure</u></strong></p>

<p>Customers without an on-line account or Sherwin-Williams charge account cannot be reasonably validated.&nbsp; Please see chart above to understand what PI we may have collected, the purpose of collection and with whom we may have shared it with.&nbsp; Customers with an on-line account will be asked to log into their account in a specific time frame.&nbsp; After successful log in, we will provide you with the categories of PI we have collected specific to you.&nbsp; Customers with a Sherwin-Williams charge account may be asked for up to three unique pieces of account-related information and may also be required to return a signed legal verification document.&nbsp; After successful verification of information, we will provide you with the specific pieces of PI we have collected about you.</p>

<p><strong><u>“Do Not Sell” Rights</u></strong></p>

<p>We do not sell California Consumer PI as defined under the CCPA, and until such time as we change our practices by updating this Privacy Notice, will treat PI collected under this Notice as subject to a “do not sell” request.&nbsp; Some browsers have signals that may be characterized as “do not track” signals, but we do not understand them to operate in that manner, or to signify a “do not sell” request.&nbsp; We understand that various parties are developing “do not sell” signals, and we may recognize certain such signals if we conclude such a program is appropriate.</p>

<p><strong><u>Deletion Rights</u></strong></p>

<p>You may request that we delete your PI that we have collected directly from you.&nbsp; Under the CCPA, we may decline to delete your PI under certain circumstances, for example, if we need the PI to complete transactions or provide services you have requested or that are reasonably anticipated, for security purposes, for legitimate internal business purposes (including maintaining business records), to comply with law, or to exercise or defend legal claims.&nbsp; Note also that we are not required to delete your PI that we did not collect directly from you.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Non-Discrimination and Financial Incentive Programs</u></strong></p>

<p>We will not discriminate against you in a manner prohibited by the CCPA because you exercise your CCPA rights. We may charge a different price or rate, or offer a different level or quality of goods or services, if doing so is reasonably related to the value of applicable data. We may offer you financial incentives from time to time, such as sales, discounts, or coupons, relating to the collection, sale, retention and use of your PI as permitted by CCPA. This would include a preferred customer or other similar rewards program. Such offers may result in reasonably different prices, rates, or quality levels. The material aspects of any financial incentive will be explained and described in its program terms. The value of each of incentive such as sales, discounts or coupons is reflected in the documents or communications relating to that incentive. Participating in incentive programs is entirely optional; you can opt into or opt out of the program at any time by following the instructions in the program’s description and terms. We may add or change incentive programs or their terms by posting a notice on the program descriptions and terms, so check them regularly.</p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Tracking Technologies We Use</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Baxter Sites utilize various technologies (such as cookies, web beacons, Javascript, Etags and others) in order to provide you with certain services and functionalities as follows.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><span>Cookies</span></span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Like many websites, Baxter Sites may use "cookies." A cookie is a small file that is transferred to your computer's hard drive to help us improve content (e.g., it helps us determine which parts of the Site are popular and which are less popular, so we may improve these areas in the future) and customize website content for our visitors.&nbsp; You may set your browser to reject cookies and to let you know when a cookie is being placed on your computer.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>As is true of most websites, the Baxter Sites gather certain information automatically. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the Site.&nbsp; IP addresses and other data we gather automatically may be considered to be Personal Information in certain countries. &nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Use of cookies may vary with the unique features of Baxter websites. Therefore, please review the individual privacy terms for the specific Baxter Site you are visiting for any additional information on the use of cookies by the particular Baxter Site.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Generally, the Baxter Sites use cookies (and the other technologies identified in this Privacy Statement) for the following purposes:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul><li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>To provide a service: A cookie may be used to provide you with a specific service. For instance, if you are logging into an access-controlled section of our Site, we set a temporary session cookie to establish that you have been authenticated. The information contained in these cookies consists of random data that is used by the server to authenticate the browser requests to the server for that particular session. If you choose not to accept a temporary cookie, you will not be able to navigate in these online applications. We also use a cookie when you visit our Site and request documentation or a response from us. When you are filling out a form, you may be given the option of having our Site deliver a cookie to your local hard drive.

You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our Site or service.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>To facilitate Site use: If a cookie is used, our Site will be able to remember information about your preferences and movement, either until you exit your current browser window (if the cookie is temporary) or until you disable or delete the cookie. Many users prefer to use cookies in order to help them navigate a website as seamlessly as possible.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>To understand our visitors: When you visit our Site, our computers may automatically collect statistics in aggregate about visitor behavior. We may monitor statistics and other data such as how many people visit our Site, the user's IP address, which pages people visit, from which domains our visitors come, which browsers people use and how they move about our Site. We use this data about your visit for aggregation purposes only. These statistics are used to help us to understand our visitors’ interests and improve the content and performance of our Site.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>To serve ads:&nbsp; We may also engage third party service providers to place pixels or other tracking technology on our Site on behalf of Baxter to personalize the content of, as well as to serve you ads on third party websites regarding Baxter goods or services that may be of interest to you based upon your interaction with the Baxter Sites.&nbsp; Some of the ads on third party websites may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on what we, or the third party service provider serving the ad, know about you or your computer's browsing activity on both the Baxter Sites and third-party websites. You may also opt-out of receiving personalized ads from our third party service providers by adjusting your browser settings to not accept cookies.&nbsp; Please see the “help” section of your browser for instructions on managing security preferences.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>To opt-out of interest-based advertising by participating companies in the following consumer choice mechanisms, please visit:<br><br>
-Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)’s self-regulatory opt-out page (http://optout.aboutads.info/) and mobile application-based "AppChoices" download page (https://youradchoices.com/appchoices)<br>
-European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)'s consumer opt-out page (http://youronlinechoices.eu)<br>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>In the mobile environment, most mobile operating systems offer device-based opt-out choices that are transmitted to companies providing interest-based advertising. To set an opt-out preference for a mobile device identifier (such as Apple's IDFA or Android's GAID), visit the device manufacturer's current choice instructions pages, or read more about sending signals to limit ad tracking for your operating system here: </span></span></span><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices." target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="external-link"><span><span>http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices.</span></span></a></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Baxter may provide embedded videos on the Baxter Sites.&nbsp; Such embedded videos are hosted by third party video providers, including but not limited to Youtube (Google).&nbsp; If you click “play” on a video embedded on a Baxter Site, the third-party video provider may consider your click on “play” to be consent to utilize cookies specific to that third-party video provider.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><span>Do Not Track</span></span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Certain laws require Baxter to indicate whether we honor “Do Not Track” settings in your browser concerning targeted advertising.&nbsp; As of the effective date of this Privacy Statement, an industry standard has not yet been established on how to respond to these signals, and therefore Baxter does not currently respond to such signals.&nbsp; Instead, we adhere to the standards set out in this Privacy Statement.&nbsp; If you have any questions, please contact us using the information provided below. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><span>Web Beacons</span></span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Our Site pages contain electronic images (called a "single-pixel gif" or "web beacon") that allow us to count page views or to access our cookies. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. Web beacons are typically very small, 1 by 1 pixel size, banner-like files, but their presence can be easily seen within Internet Explorer by clicking on "View" and then on "Source." Web beacons are so small in order not to use valuable space on the computer screen that is better used to display helpful content. We also may include web beacons in HTML-formatted newsletters containing graphics that we send to opt-in subscribers in order to count how many newsletters have been read. In addition, some advertising networks that serve ads on our websites may use web beacons within their clearly visible banner advertisements. Our web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor, or share any Personal Information about our Site visitors. They are just the technique we use to compile our anonymous, aggregated statistics about Site usage.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><span>Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses</span></span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Internet protocol (IP) addresses are unique identifiers automatically assigned to each computer when logging onto the Internet. We generally collect IP address information from any visitor to our Sites and log them for system administrative purposes. This information helps us prepare aggregate demographic information and other information regarding the use of the Baxter Site, and improve its functions. In some cases, as described above, we may also use IP addresses to serve you ads on third party websites regarding Baxter goods or services that may be of interest to you based upon your interaction with the Baxter Sites.&nbsp; As described above, you may opt out of such technology by adjusting your browser settings to not accept cookies.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><span>Google Analytics</span></span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Google Analytics is an element of the Baxter Sites. By using cookies, Google Analytics collects and stores data such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the Baxter Sites, the IP address, and the type of operating system used in the devices used to access the Baxter Site. By downloading and using a browser plugin provided by Google (available here:&nbsp;</span></span></span><a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="external-link"><span><span><span><span><span>https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span>), you can choose to opt out of Google Analytics.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

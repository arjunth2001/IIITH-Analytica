<h2>THIRD-PARTY COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR ONLINE ACTIVITIES OVER TIME AND ACROSS DIFFERENT WEB SITES.</h2>
<p>We allow certain third parties to collect information, including Personal Information, about your online activities on our Sites, and on and across different websites after you leave our Sites. In addition, other third parties with which we have no business relationship may be tracking your online behavior across the Internet including when you visit our Sites.

<h2>DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS.</h2>
	<p>Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable "Do Not Track" functionality. "Do Not Track" is a browser setting that requests that web applications eliminate their tracking of you. When you choose to turn on your "Do Not Track" setting, your browser sends a signal to third-party ad servers, digital advertising networks, digital advertising networks, data aggregators and others to stop tracking you. This is different than disabling cookies on your browser. Browsers with the "Do Not Track" functionality enabled continue to have the capability to accept cookies. There is currently no agreement or consensus on how companies should interpret a "Do Not Track" signal. Consequently, we do not honor "Do Not Track" signals or other mechanisms that provide you with the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of information (including your Personal Information) relating to your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. Instead, we allow you to exercise control over the collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. For more information about "Do Not Track," please visit <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/" target="_blank">www.allaboutdnt.org</a>.</p>
<h2>YOU MAY CONTROL THE SHARING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES FOR THEIR DIRECT MARKETING.</h2>
<p>D.R. Horton does not disclose your Personal Information to third parties, including our Affiliates, for such third parties' direct marketing purposes, if you have exercised an option to prevent such disclosure, or, if you are a resident of the European Economic Area, without your consent. To this end, we hereby notify you that you may control our disclosure to third parties, including our Affiliates, for their direct marketing purposes, of Personal Information about you that we may have collected, online or otherwise, by visiting <a href="https://www.drhorton.com/Your-Privacy-Choices">Your Privacy Choices</a>.</p>
<h2>SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER PRIVACY POLICY.</h2>
<p>D.R. Horton, as an employer, in the normal course of business and as required by law, collects social security numbers. In connection with accepting job applications, we will collect Personal Information from prospective new employees, including their social security number. This information is transmitted over a secure connection that implements encryption of the Personal Information being transmitted. In addition to secure connections and encryption for collection, we maintain other reasonable measures to protect and limit access to social security numbers on a need-to-know basis. In addition, we prohibit their unlawful disclosure. We maintain reasonable procedures to destroy, erase, or make unreadable any data, computer files and documents containing social security numbers prior to their disposal. Failure to follow these procedures by any employee may subject the employee to disciplinary action up to, and including, termination.</p>

In such cases, we will provide prominent notice of such changes before they take effect.</p><p>
 Where applicable, your continued use of our products and services after the effective date of the Privacy Policy means that you accept the revised Privacy Policy.

<h2>DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS.</h2>
	<p>Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable "Do Not Track" functionality. "Do Not Track" is a browser setting that requests that web applications eliminate their tracking of you. When you choose to turn on your "Do Not Track" setting, your browser sends a signal to third-party ad servers, digital advertising networks, digital advertising networks, data aggregators and others to stop tracking you. This is different than disabling cookies on your browser. Browsers with the "Do Not Track" functionality enabled continue to have the capability to accept cookies. There is currently no agreement or consensus on how companies should interpret a "Do Not Track" signal. Consequently, we do not honor "Do Not Track" signals or other mechanisms that provide you with the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of information (including your Personal Information) relating to your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. Instead, we allow you to exercise control over the collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

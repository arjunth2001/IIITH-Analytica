For example, this includes your name, home address, phone number, email address and any other information that we tie to these elements.</p>
<p>Personal Information does not include "aggregated information," which is information that we collect about a group or category of persons or services.  It also does not include "de-identified information," which is information from which we or our agents have removed information that can be used to specifically identify a person. This Privacy Policy does not apply to our collection, use, or disclosure of aggregated or de-identified information.</p>
<h3><a name="collect-use-personal-info" id="collect-use-personal-info"></a><u>How We Collect and Use Personal Information</u></h3>
<p>We collect Personal Information through our Services. &nbsp;There are five categories of information that we collect through the Services:</p>
<h4>1. Information You Provide</h4>
<ul style="padding-left: 40.0px;">
<li style="list-style: disc;">We collect Personal Information you provide, for example when you enter the information into form fields on our Services.  For example, we may collect:</li>

<li style="list-style: disc;">demographic information, including age, information about your household, product preferences and other interests and likes, which we use to better understand and analyze our customer population, support our operations including inventory and product management, to deliver relevant offers and ads, and to improve our products and services including the Services;</li>

<li style="list-style: disc;">with your permission, information from your device's applications, such as the camera to allow you to scan barcodes to add items to your shopping list or your contacts to allow you to update your information.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Information Collected Automatically</h4>

This information may include IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and/or clickstream data.  We generally only use this data for purposes such as security, fraud detection, and protecting our rights.</p>
<p><b>Cookies and Other Data Collection Technologies:</b> We and our subsidiaries, and service providers use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to manage our websites and email messages and to collect and track information about you and your activities online over time and across different websites and social media channels.  In addition, we use local shared objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and how you interact with our websites and mobile applications. These technologies help us to recognize you, customize or personalize your shopping experience, store items in your online shopping list between visits, and analyze the use of our Services and solutions to make them more useful to you.

<p><b>Information from Independent Stores:</b> As described under the section titled "Independent Stores" above, we provide website and mobile app hosting services and receive customer data from the Independent Stores.   We collect, use and share this Personal Information in ways permitted by our agreements with the Independent Stores.</p>
<p><b>Single Sign-On:</b> Some of our Services allow you to register and login to our Services through a third-party platform such as Facebook.   When you login to our service through a third-party platform, you allow us to access and collect any information from your third-party platform account permitted under the settings and privacy policy of that platform.</p>
<p><b>Pharmacy Data:</b> Some of our stores have an associated pharmacy.  For the data collection, use and disclosure practices of the pharmacies, please see the section titled <b>"Pharmacy Operations"</b> below.</p>

<p><b>Supplemental Information</b>: We may receive additional Personal Information from third- party sources that we may append to existing consumer information, such as email and address verification.  We use this supplemental information to better understand our consumers, deliver relevant offers and advertising, and improve our operations, stores, Services and our advertising and marketing campaigns.</p>

<h4>4. Location Information</h4>
<p>We collect location information through the Services so we can offer you certain location-based services (such as delivering advertisements that are relevant to your particular location, and conducting analytics to improve our stores and the Services).  The way in which we collect location information is different depending on whether you are accessing the Services through a website or a mobile application.</p>

<p>If you are accessing the Services through a website, we use various technologies, including IP lookup, to detect your location so that we can automatically show you the closest store to your area, rather than some random location. Depending on browser type, your browser may inform you that the Site would like to collect your location and request your permission to do so. If you allow it, location information is then collected and may be stored locally on your device. If you decline the collection of location information, your location is not collected, and you must manually enter your location.</p>

<p>If you are viewing our content on a social media platform, location information may be collected by the third-party platform. We do not control the collection, use or disclosure of location information on social media platforms. To opt out of location information sharing, please set your preferences within your social profile settings or follow the instructions on the social media platform.</p>

<p>If you are using a mobile app, you will be prompted to provide your consent for us to collect your location information. If you decline to allow us to collect your location information, you must manually type-in your preferred store or location so that we can show you the local store or send offers that are available in your area.</p>

<p>If you allow us to collect your location information, we collect precise location information.  Whether and to what extent we can collect this information is controlled by your operating system, but the methods of collection typically include GPS, cellular network location and other location-based services.  Depending on the operating system, we typically receive the location of your mobile device expressed as latitude and longitude, as well as date and time.  Please note that the precision of this data varies greatly and is determined by factors controlled by your device or mobile service provider.</p>

<p>If you elect to allow the mobile app to collect location information while the mobile app is running in the background, you will have enabled continuous location collection.  This allows us to show you offers, coupons and advertisements relevant to current location and help you find our stores nearest to you.  We also use this location information to conduct analytics and improve our operations as well as the Services themselves.</p>

<p>You can turn off location collection through your device settings or by deleting our mobile app from your device.</p>

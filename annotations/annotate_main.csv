"Company uses information collected from the Website and Service in several ways, as outlined in this policy. For example, we use Personal Information as needed to provide Website and Services, to create Accounts, and to communicate with Registered Users. We also use both Personal Information and Non-Personal Information when evaluating ways to improve the Website and the Service. As further described below, in limited circumstances we may disclose collected information, including Personal Information, to certain third parties in connection with providing Services or as required by law.

We also use information collected through the Website and the Service to communicate with Registered Users from whom such information was collected in order to provide promotional materials about us. However, unlike communications which are necessary to provide Services (""Necessary Communications""), promotional communications are optional (""Optional Communications""), and Company will refrain from sending that kind of information to you if you inform us that you prefer not to receive them, as described in more detail below. Company uses Non-Personal Information in a variety of ways, including, by way of example, to evaluate the performance of the Website and Service and the general preferences of users, or to generate anonymous statistics for our benefit or for our business partners. Because Non-Personal Information is entirely anonymous, and therefore can never be used by us to identify you, this policy does not limit our ability to use or disclose Non-Personal Information. We may create Non-Personal Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that make the data personally identifiable to you. If we collect information through the Website and/or the Service that you provide to us voluntarily through online forms or surveys, through e-mail communications or by other means, we will treat that information as described above, as applied to both Personal Information and Non-Personal Information. As a necessary part of providing Services, we may disclose information collected from you as described in this policy. For example, we may disclose certain Personal Information about you to our third-party service providers (e.g., our third party payment processors), so long as they are only using the Personal Information to provide services to us. If another company acquires our company, business, or our assets, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by it and us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. Under certain limited circumstances, we may cooperate with legal investigations and/or we may be subject to legal requirements to disclose information collected through the Website or Services, such as, by way of example, to a court or a governmental agency, and our policy is to provide such cooperation and comply fully with all such legal requirements. We may also disclose Personal Information to protect or defend the rights or property of Company or users of the Services and/or to investigate any violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, or terms and conditions. The disclosures contemplated by this paragraph (""Necessary Disclosures"") are necessary if you wish to use the Service.

If you do not want us to make such Necessary Disclosures, or to use Non-Personal Information without restriction, you must not use the Service.
